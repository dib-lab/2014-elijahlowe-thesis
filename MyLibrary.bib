	abstract = {Neural crest cells arise from the neural tube shortly after its closure and migrate extensively through prescribed regions of the embryos, where they differentiate into most of the peripheral nervous system as well as the facial skeleton and pigment cells. Along the embryonic axis, several distinct neural crest populations differ both in their migratory pathways and range of derivatives. Whereas those cells arising from the midbrain migrate as a uniform sheet of cells, neural crest cells emerging from the hindbrain and trunk regions migrate in a segmented manner. For example, trunk neural crest cells move preferentially through the rostral, but not caudal, half of each somite. Interactions with tissues encountered during migration strongly influence this segmental migratory pattern. For example, the mesodermal somites dictate the segmental migration of trunk neural crest cells and the otic placode appears to attract hindbrain neural crest cells. Although little is known about the molecular basis underlying migration, patterns of gene expression in the hindbrain are thought to contribute to the segmental arrangement of neural crest cells. Furthermore, neural crest cells possess integrin receptors that may be important for interacting with extracellular matrix molecules in their surroundings.},

Perhaps the most distinct example of vertebrate {PCP} is the uniform orientation of stereociliary bundles at the apices of sensory hair cells in the mammalian auditory sensory organ. The establishment of {PCP} in the mammalian cochlea occurs concurrently with {CE} in this ciliated epithelium, therefore linking three cellular processes regulated by the vertebrate {PCP} pathway in the same tissue and emerging as a model system for dissecting {PCP} signaling. This review summarizes the morphogenesis of this model system to assist the interpretation of the emerging data and proposes molecular mechanisms underlying {PCP} signaling in vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Differences in gene expression are thought to be an important source of phenotypic diversity, so dissecting the genetic components of natural variation in gene expression is important for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to adaptation. Gene expression is a complex trait that, in diploid organisms, results from transcription of both maternal and paternal alleles. Directly measuring allelic expression rather than total gene expression offers greater insight into regulatory variation. The recent emergence of high-throughput sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to study allelic transcription at a genomic scale for virtually any species. By sequencing transcript pools derived from heterozygous individuals, estimates of allelic expression can be directly obtained. The statistical power of this approach is influenced by the number of transcripts sequenced and the ability to unambiguously assign individual sequence fragments to specific alleles on the basis of transcribed nucleotide polymorphisms. Here, using mathematical modelling and computer simulations, we determine the minimum sequencing depth required to accurately measure relative allelic expression and detect allelic imbalance via high-throughput sequencing under a variety of conditions. We conclude that, within a species, a minimum of 500-1000 sequencing reads per gene are needed to test for allelic imbalance, and consequently, at least five to 10 millions reads are required for studying a genome expressing 10 000 genes. Finally, using 454 sequencing, we illustrate an application of allelic expression by testing for cis-regulatory divergence between closely related Drosophila species.},

	abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is critical for organismal function and is an important source of phenotypic diversity between species. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulatory divergence is therefore expected to provide insight into evolutionary change. Using deep sequencing, we quantified total and allele-specific {mRNA} expression levels genome-wide in two closely related Drosophila species (D. melanogaster and D. sechellia) and their F(1) hybrids. We show that 78\% of expressed genes have divergent expression between species, and that cis- and trans-regulatory divergence affects 51\% and 66\% of expressed genes, respectively, with 35\% of genes showing evidence of both. This is a relatively larger contribution of trans-regulatory divergence than was expected based on prior studies, and may result from the unique demographic history of D. sechellia. Genes with antagonistic cis- and trans-regulatory changes were more likely to be misexpressed in hybrids, consistent with the idea that such regulatory changes contribute to hybrid incompatibilities. In addition, cis-regulatory differences contributed more to divergent expression of genes that showed additive rather than nonadditive inheritance. A correlation between sequence similarity and the conservation of cis-regulatory activity was also observed that appears to be a general feature of regulatory evolution. Finally, we examined regulatory divergence that may have contributed to the evolution of a specific trait–divergent feeding behavior in D. sechellia. Overall, this study illustrates the power of {mRNA} sequencing for investigating regulatory evolution, provides novel insight into the evolution of gene expression in Drosophila, and reveals general trends that are likely to extend to other species.},

	title = {Factors Necessary for Restoring an Evolutionary Change in an Anural Ascidian Embryo},
	volume = {153},
	abstract = {The ascidian Molgula oculata has a tailed (or urodele) larva, whereas Molgula occulta develops directly via a tailless (or anural) embryo. Interspecific hybrid embryos produced by fertilizing M. occulta eggs with M. oculata sperm (M. occulta x M. oculata hybrids) can develop urodele larval structures, including a brain pigment cell and a short tail containing a small notochord. Development of larval features differs in individual M. occulta clutches: some eggs develop into hybrids with both a brain pigment cell and a tail, some into hybrids with either a brain pigment cell or a tail, and others into hybrids without urodele features. The expression of a 58-{kDa} protein (p58), which is present in eggs and embryos of urodele ascidians but lacking in those of most anural species, also varies in expression between different clutches of M. occulta eggs. Western blot and immunofluorescence studies show that p58 expression is correlated with the ability of hybrid embryos to express urodele features. For example, clutches of M. occulta eggs containing relatively high levels of p58 produce many hybrids with both a brain pigment cell and a tail. Differential expression of p58 occurs during oogenesis in M. occulta individuals: p58 is found at similar levels in previtellogenic oocytes, but in some animals it disappears during vitellogenesis, while in others it persists throughout oogenesis and is present in mature eggs. When M. occulta eggs are extracted with Triton X-100, p58 remains in the detergent-insoluble fraction, suggesting that it is associated with the cytoskeleton. In most unfertilized M. occulta eggs, p58 is uniformly distributed, but after fertilization it is localized in the uncleaved zygote and then concentrated in embryonic ectoderm, notochord, and muscle lineage cells. Despite containing high levels of p58, gynogenetic hybrid embryos, produced by fertilizing M. occulta eggs with uv-irradiated M. oculata sperm, develop into hybrids without a brain pigment cell or a tail. The results suggest that both a functional paternal genome and p58 are necessary for restoration of larval features in M. occulta x M. oculata hybrids. The cytoskeletal complex containing p58 may mediate the localization of key maternal factors in the egg or may be involved in cellular interactions during embryogenesis which are responsible for development of urodele cell fates.},

Algorithms for computing maximal exact matches ({MEMs}) between sequences appear in two contexts where high-throughput sequencing will vastly increase the volume of sequence data: (i) seeding alignments of high-throughput reads for genome assembly and (ii) designating anchor points for genome-genome comparisons. {RESULTS}: We introduce a new algorithm for finding {MEMs}. The algorithm leverages a sparse suffix array ({SA}), a text index that stores every K-th position of the text. In contrast to a full text index that stores every position of the text, a sparse {SA} occupies much less memory. Even though we use a sparse index, the output of our algorithm is the same as a full text index algorithm as long as the space between the indexed suffixes is not greater than a minimum length of a {MEM}. By relying on partial matches and additional text scanning between indexed positions, the algorithm trades memory for extra computation. The reduced memory usage makes it possible to determine {MEMs} between significantly longer sequences. {AVAILABILITY}: Source code for the algorithm is available under a {BSD} open source license at http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/mems. The implementation can serve as a drop-in replacement for the {MEMs} algorithm in {MUMmer} 3.},

	abstract = {Ascidians exhibit two different modes of development. A tadpole larva is formed during urodele development, whereas the larval phase is modified or absent during anural development. Anural development is restricted to a small number of species in one or possibly two ascidian families and is probably derived from ancestors with urodele development. Anural and urodele ascidians constitute a model system in which to study the evolution of development, but the phylogeny of anural development has not been resolved. Classification based on larval characters suggests that anural species are monophyletic, whereas classification according to adult morphology suggests they are polyphyletic. In the present study, we have inferred the origin of anural development using {rDNA} sequences. The central region of 18S {rDNA} and the hypervariable D2 loop of 28S {rDNA} were amplified from the genomic {DNA} of anural and urodele ascidian species by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Phylogenetic trees inferred from 18S {rDNA} sequences of 21 species placed anural developers into two discrete groups corresponding to the Styelidae and Molgulidae, suggesting that anural development evolved independently in these families. Furthermore, the 18S {rDNA} trees inferred at least four independent origins of anural development in the family Molgulidae. Phylogenetic trees inferred from the D2 loop sequences of 13 molgulid species confirmed the 18S {rDNA} phylogeny. Anural development appears to have evolved rapidly because some anural species are placed as closely related sister groups to urodele species. The phylogeny inferred from {rDNA} sequences is consistent with molgulid systematics according to adult morphology and supports the polyphyletic origin of anural development in ascidians.},

	abstract = {The myoplasm of ascidian eggs is a localized cytoskeletal domain that is segregated to presumptive larval tail muscle cells during embryonic development. We have identified a cytoskeletal protein recognized by a vertebrate neurofilament monoclonal antibody ({NN}18) which is concentrated in the myoplasm in eggs and embryos of a variety of ascidian species. The {NN}18 antigen is localized in the periphery of unfertilized eggs, segregates with the myoplasm after fertilization, and enters the larval tail muscle cells during embryonic development. Western blots of one-dimensional and two-dimensional gels showed that the major component recognized by {NN}18 antibody is a 58 x 10(3) Mr protein (p58), which exists in at least three different isoforms. The enrichment of p58 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of eggs and its reticular staining pattern in eggs and embryos suggests that it is a cytoskeletal protein. In subsequent experiments, p58 was used as a marker to determine whether changes in the myoplasm occur in eggs of anural ascidian species, i.e. those exhibiting a life cycle lacking tadpole larvae with differentiated muscle cells. Although p58 was localized in the myoplasm in eggs of four urodele ascidian species that develop into swimming tadpole larvae, this protein was distributed uniformly in eggs of three anural ascidian species. The eggs of two of these anural species contained the actin lamina, another component of the myoplasm, whereas the third anural species lacked the actin lamina. There was no detectible localization of p58 after fertilization or segregation into muscle lineage cells during cleavage of anural eggs. {NN}18 antigen was uniformly distributed in pre-vitellogenic oocytes and then localized in the perinuclear zone during vitellogenesis of urodele and anural ascidians. Subsequently, {NN}18 antigen was concentrated in the peripheral cytoplasm of post-vitellogenic oocytes and mature eggs of urodele, but not anural, ascidians. It is concluded that the myoplasm of ascidian eggs contains an intermediate filament-like cytoskeletal network which is missing in anural species that have modified or eliminated the tadpole larva.},

	abstract = {The T-box transcription factor gene Brachyury is important for the differentiation of notochord in all chordates, including the ascidians Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis. We isolated Brachyury from molgulid ascidians, which have evolved tailless larvae multiple times independently, and found the genes appear functional by {cDNA} sequence analyses. We then compared the expression of Mocu-Bra in tailed Molgula oculata embryos to two tailless species, Molgula occulta (Mocc-Bra) and Molgula tectiformis (Mt-Bra). Here we show that both tailless species express Brachyury in the notochord lineage during embryogenesis. Initial expression of Mocu-Bra is normal in tailed M. oculata embryos; 10 precursor notochord cells divide twice to result in 40 notochord cells that converge and extend to make a notochord down the center of the tail. In contrast, in tailless Molgula occulta, Mocc-Bra expression disappears prematurely, and there is only one round of division, resulting in 20 cells in the final notochord lineage that never converge or extend. In M. occulta x M. oculata hybrid embryos, expression of Mocu-Bra is prolonged, and the embryos form a tail with 20 notochord cells that converge and extend normally. However, in Molgula tectiformis, a different tailless ascidian, Mt-Bra was expressed only in the 10 notochord precursor cells, which never divide, converge, or extend. In summary, neither Brachyury function nor the early establishment of the notochord lineage appears to be impaired in tailless embryos. In light of these results, we are continuing to investigate how and why notochord development is lost in tailless molgulid ascidian embryos.},

Conversely, by understanding the rules of binding, we can infer structural characteristics. We have developed an information theory based method for approximating the physical limitations of cooperative interactions by comparing sequence analysis to microarray expression data. When applied to the coordinated binding of the sulfur amino acid regulatory protein Met4 by Cbf1 and Met31, we were able to create a combinatorial model that can correctly identify Met4 regulated genes. Interestingly, we found that the major determinant of Met4 regulation was the sum of the strength of the Cbf1 and Met31 binding sites and that the energetic costs associated with spacing appeared to be minimal.},

This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fate specification mainly uncovered in model ascidian species--Halocynthia roretzi, Ciona intestinalis, and Ciona savignyi. One category of developmentally important molecules represents maternal localized {mRNAs} that are involved in cell-autonomous processes. In the second category, signaling molecules and downstream transcription factors are involved in inductive cell interactions.

We approached this issue in the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, which develops into a tadpole larva with a small number of cells. The embryonic cells divide 11 times on average from fertilization to hatching. The number of cell division rounds varies among tissue types. For example, notochord cells divide 9 times and give rise to large postmitotic cells in the tadpole. The number of cell division rounds in partial embryos derived from tissue-precursor blastomeres isolated at the 64-cell stage also varied between tissues and coincided with their counterparts in the intact whole embryos to some extent, suggesting tissue-autonomous regulation of cell division. Manipulation of cell fates in notochord, nerve cord, muscle, and mesenchyme lineage cells by inhibition or ectopic activation of the inductive {FGF} signal changed the number of cell divisions according to the altered fate. Knockdown and missexpression of Brachyury (Bra), an {FGF}-induced notochord-specific key transcription factor for notochord differentiation, indicated that Bra is also responsible for regulation of the number of cell division rounds, suggesting that Bra activates a putative mechanism to halt cell division at a specific stage. The outcome of precocious expression of Bra suggests that the mechanism involves a putative developmental clock that is likely shared in blastomeres other than those of notochord and functions to terminate cell division at three rounds after the 64-cell stage. Precocious expression of Bra has no effect on progression of the developmental clock itself.},

	abstract = {The cells of many embryonic tissues actively narrow in one dimension (convergence) and lengthen in the perpendicular dimension (extension). Convergence and extension are ubiquitous and important tissue movements in metazoan morphogenesis. In vertebrates, the dorsal axial and paraxial mesodermal tissues, the notochordal and somitic mesoderm, converge and extend. In amphibians as well as a number of other organisms where these movements appear, they occur by mediolateral cell intercalation, the rearrangement of cells along the mediolateral axis to produce an array that is narrower in this axis and longer in the anteroposterior axis. In amphibians, mesodermal cell intercalation is driven by bipolar, mediolaterally directed protrusive activity, which appears to exert traction on adjacent cells and pulls the cells between one another. In addition, the notochordal-somitic boundary functions in convergence and extension by 'capturing' notochordal cells as they contact the boundary, thus elongating the boundary. The prospective neural tissue also actively converges and extends parallel with the mesoderm. In contrast to the mesoderm, cell intercalation in the neural plate normally occurs by monopolar protrusive activity directed medially, towards the midline notoplate-floor-plate region. In contrast, the notoplate-floor-plate region appears to converge and extend by adhering to and being towed by or perhaps migrating on the underlying notochord. Converging and extending mesoderm stiffens by a factor of three or four and exerts up to 0.6 {microN} force. Therefore, active, force-producing convergent extension, the mechanism of cell intercalation, requires a mechanism to actively pull cells between one another while maintaining a tissue stiffness sufficient to push with a substantial force. Based on the evidence thus far, a cell-cell traction model of intercalation is described. The essential elements of such a morphogenic machine appear to be (i) bipolar, mediolaterally orientated or monopolar, medially directed protrusive activity; (ii) this protrusive activity results in mediolaterally orientated or medially directed traction of cells on one another; (iii) tractive protrusions are confined to the ends of the cells; (iv) a mechanically stable cell cortex over the bulk of the cell body which serves as a movable substratum for the orientated or directed cell traction. The implications of this model for cell adhesion, regulation of cell motility and cell polarity, and cell and tissue biomechanics are discussed.},

Qeseq employs critical novel elements, such as iterative recalibration and neighbor joining of reads to identify enriched regions of any length. To objectively assess its performance relative to other 14 {ChIP}-Seq peak finders, we designed a novel protocol based on Validation Discriminant Analysis ({VDA}) to optimally select validation sites and generated two validation datasets, which are the most comprehensive to date for algorithmic benchmarking of key epigenetic marks. In addition, we systematically explored a total of 315 diverse parameter configurations from these algorithms and found that typically optimal parameters in one dataset do not generalize to other datasets. Nevertheless, default parameters show the most stable performance, suggesting that they should be used. This study also provides a reproducible and generalizable methodology for unbiased comparative analysis of high-throughput sequencing tools that can facilitate future algorithmic development.},

An alternative approach can provide limits as to the number of identical subunits present in chromatids. This method is based on the demonstration that nucleotide sequence diversity may be estimated from the kinetics of renaturation of denatured {DNA}. Measurements of {DNA} content and renaturation rate constants are given for several eukaryotic {DNAs}. Control experiments involved measurements of renaturation kinetics of {DNAs} from bacteria and bacteriophage. These estimates show that most of the nucleotide sequences in mouse, Drosophila, and Ciona {DNA} are present only once per sperm. Since the reduction of {DNA} content during meiosis indicates that mouse sperm contain a haploid set of chromatids, it follows that a set of mouse meiotic chromatids contains a single copy of most sequences. Models of chromatid structure which postulate multiple subunits with identical nucleotide sequences are therefore not tenable for mouse meiotic chromatids. This method of analyzing nucleotide sequence diversity may be of general use in designing models of chromatid structure in other organisms.},

Computationally, this problem is often addressed by motif discovery, where the goal is to find a set of mutually similar subsequences within a collection of input sequences. Though motif discovery is widely studied and many approaches to it have been suggested, it remains a challenging and as yet unresolved problem. {RESULTS}: We introduce {SAMF} (Solution-Aggregating Motif Finder), a novel approach for motif discovery. {SAMF} is based on a Markov Random Field formulation, and its key idea is to uncover and aggregate multiple statistically significant solutions to the given motif finding problem. In contrast to many earlier methods, {SAMF} does not require prior estimates on the number of motif instances present in the data, is not limited by motif length, and allows motifs to overlap. Though {SAMF} is broadly applicable, these features make it particularly well suited for addressing the challenges of prokaryotic regulatory element detection. We test {SAMF}'s ability to find transcription factor binding sites in an Escherichia coli dataset and show that it outperforms previous methods. Additionally, we uncover a number of previously unidentified binding sites in this data, and provide evidence that they correspond to actual regulatory elements. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Distinguishing adaptive changes driven by positive selection from neutral divergence resulting from mutation and genetic drift is critical for understanding the evolution of gene expression. Here, we review the various methods that have been used to test for signs of selection in genomic expression data. We also discuss properties of regulatory systems relevant to neutral models of gene expression. Despite some potential caveats, published studies provide considerable evidence for adaptive changes in gene expression. Future challenges for studies of regulatory evolution will be to quantify the frequency of adaptive changes, identify the genetic basis of expression divergence and associate changes in gene expression with specific organismal phenotypes.},

We tested our systems on a data set consisting of greater than 12 Mb of high-quality sequence from 12 vertebrate species. All the sequence was derived from the genomic region orthologous to an approximately 1.5-Mb region on human chromosome 7q31.3. We found that both {LAGAN} and Multi-{LAGAN} compare favorably with other leading alignment methods in correctly aligning protein-coding exons, especially between distant homologs such as human and chicken, or human and fugu. Multi-{LAGAN} produced the most accurate alignments, while requiring just 75 minutes on a personal computer to obtain the multiple alignment of all 12 sequences. Multi-{LAGAN} is a practical method for generating multiple alignments of long genomic sequences at any evolutionary distance. Our systems are publicly available at http://lagan.stanford.edu.},

This suggests that, during the evolution of the Chordate phylum, the Dlx genes arose from an ancestral Dll/Dlx gene via gene duplication. We have previously reported the isolation of two Dll-related homeoboxes from the protochordate Ciona intestinalis, and described their clustered arrangement (Gene 156 (1995) 253). Here we present the detailed genomic organization and spatial-temporal expression of these two genes, Ci-Dll-A and Ci-Dll-B, and describe the isolation and characterization of another member of the ascidian family of Dll-related genes, which we tentatively named Ci-Dll-C.},

Initially, the developmental fates of all blastomeres of the 64-cell stage embryo were examined, and thereafter, only the fates of daughter blastomeres of those blastomeres that were not tissue restricted at the 64-cell stage were traced. The developmental fates of blastomeres were highly invariant except for two candidates for “equivalence groups” (J. Kimble, J. Sulston, and J. White (1979). In “Cell Lineage, Stem Cells and Cell Determination,” pp. 59–68. Elsevier, Amsterdam/New York), in which cellular interaction is suggested to be involved in the specification of the fates. The right and left a8.25 cells gave rise to the otolith and ocellus, and the right and left b8.17 cells gave rise to the spinal cord and endodermal strand in a complementary manner. No fixed relationship existed between the position of the blastomere and its derivative. Most restrictions of cell fates occurred early in cleavage. The numbers of blastomeres which generated a single type of tissue were 44 at the 64-cell stage and 94 at the 110-cell stage. Eight pairs of blastomeres had not yet become tissue restricted by the 110-cell stage. Almost complete lineages of epidermis, nervous system, muscle, mesenchyme, notochord, and endodermal tissues were described, and a fate map was constructed for the blastula. For certain tissues, the primordial cells occupied two different regions. Supplementary investigations of the lineage of muscle cells were also performed on embryos of another species, Ciona intestinalis.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies offer the opportunity for population genomic study of non-model organisms sampled in the wild. The transcriptome is a convenient and popular target for such purposes. However, designing genetic markers from {NGS} transcriptome data requires assembling gene-coding sequences out of short reads. This is a complex task owing to gene duplications, genetic polymorphism, alternative splicing and transcription noise. Typical assembling programmes return thousands of predicted contigs, whose connection to the species true gene content is unclear, and from which {SNP} definition is uneasy. Here, the transcriptomes of five diverse non-model animal species (hare, turtle, ant, oyster and tunicate) were assembled from newly generated 454 and Illumina sequence reads. In two species for which a reference genome is available, a new procedure was introduced to annotate each predicted contig as either a full-length {cDNA}, fragment, chimera, allele, paralogue, genomic sequence or other, based on the number of, and overlap between, blast hits to the appropriate reference. Analyses showed that (i) the highest quality assemblies are obtained when 454 and Illumina data are combined, (ii) typical de novo assemblies include a majority of irrelevant {cDNA} predictions and (iii) assemblies can be appropriately cleaned by filtering contigs based on length and coverage. We conclude that robust, reference-free assembly of thousands of genes from transcriptomic {NGS} data is possible, opening promising perspectives for transcriptome-based population genomics in animals.

Neural crest cell fate is acquired by progressive activation of discrete groups of transcription factors that appear to be highly conserved in vertebrates; however, comprehensive analysis of their expression has been lacking in chick, an important model system for neural crest development. To address this, we analyzed expression of 10 transcription factors that are known specifiers of neural plate border and neural crest fate and compared them across developmental stages from gastrulation to neural crest migration. Surprisingly, we find that most neural crest specifiers are expressed during gastrulation in chick, concomitant with and in similar domains as neural plate border specifiers. This finding suggests that interactions between these molecules may occur much earlier than previously thought, an important consideration for interpretation of functional studies.},

These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for \{{\textbackslash}em de novo\} sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data.

The expression of Hox-like homeobox genes was analyzed by {RT}-{PCR} and in situ hybridization. Cnox1-Pc, an anterior Hox gene, is a maternal message. It is present throughout larval development, first weakly in all blastomeres and later restricted mostly to the anterior pole of the planula. Gsx, an anterior {ParaHox} gene, is first seen in the anterior endoderm but also extends into posterior regions. Cnox4-Pc, an orphan Hox-like gene, is expressed in the egg as a ring-shaped cloud around the germinal vesicle. After fertilization, the message remains in most animal blastomeres. When the embryo elongates in late blastula, staining is restricted to a few cells at the posterior pole where gastrulation will start. However, once gastrulation starts, the Cnox4-Pc signal disappears and is absent in later stages of larval development. Phylogenetic analysis shows that not all cnidarian Hox-like genes have recognizable orthologues in bilaterian groups. However, the expression analysis of Cnox1-Pc and Gsx correlates to some extent with the expression pattern of cognate genes of bilaterians, confirming the conservation of genes involved in organizing animal body plans and their putative common ancestral origin.},

We examined the expression of the newly identified notochord genes in embryos ectopically expressing Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and in embryos expressing a repressor form of this transcription factor in the notochord, and we found that while a subset of the genes examined are clearly responsive to Ci-Bra, other genes are not affected by alterations in its levels.

	abstract = {Endodermally derived organs of the gastrointestinal and respiratory system form at distinct anterioposterior and dorsoventral locations along the vertebrate body axis. This stereotyped program of organ formation depends on the correct patterning of the endodermal epithelium so that organ differentiation and morphogenesis occur at appropriate positions along the gut tube. Whereas some initial patterning of the endoderm is known to occur early, during germ-layer formation and gastrulation, later signaling events, originating from a number of adjacent tissue layers, are essential for the development of endodermal organs. Previous studies have shown that signals arising from the notochord are important for patterning of the ectodermally derived floor plate of the neural tube and the mesodermally derived somites. This review will discuss recent evidence indicating that signals arising from the notochord also play a role in regulating endoderm development.},

	abstract = {Neural crest cells ({NCCs}) are a transient embryonic structure that gives rise to a variety of cells including peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and Schwann cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying {NCC} development, a gene manipulation of {NCCs} by in ovo electroporation technique is a powerful tool, particularly in chicken embryos, the model animal that has long been used for the {NCC} research. However, since expression of introduced genes by the conventional electroporation method is transient, the mechanisms of late development of {NCCs} remain unexplored. We here report novel methods by which late-developing {NCCs} are successfully manipulated with electroporated genes. Introduced genes can be stably and/or conditionally expressed in a {NCC}-specific manner by combining 4 different techniques: Tol2 transposon-mediated genomic integration (Sato et al., 2007), a {NCC}-specific enhancer of the Sox10 gene (identified in this study), Cre/{loxP} system, and tet-on inducible expression (Watanabe et al., 2007). This is the first demonstration that late-developing {NCCs} in chickens are gene-manipulated specifically and conditionally. These methods have further allowed us to obtain ex vivo live-images of individual Schwann cells that are associated in axon bundles in peripheral tissues. Cellular activity and morphology dynamically change as development proceeds. This study has opened a new way to understand at the molecular and cellular levels how late {NCCs} develop in association with other tissues during embryogenesis.},

These motifs permitted the identification of new neurogenic enhancers with high precision: five out of seven predicted enhancers direct restricted expression within ventral regions of the neurogenic ectoderm. Mutations in some of the shared motifs disrupt enhancer function, and evidence is presented that the Twist and Su(H) regulatory proteins are essential for the specification of the ventral neurogenic ectoderm prior to gastrulation. The regulatory model of neurogenic gene expression defined in this study permitted the identification of a neurogenic enhancer in the distant Anopheles genome.

	abstract = {Increasing read length is currently viewed as the crucial condition for fragment assembly with next-generation sequencing technologies. However, introducing mate-paired reads (separated by a gap of length, {GapLength}) opens a possibility to transform short mate-pairs into long mate-reads of length approximately {GapLength}, and thus raises the question as to whether the read length (as opposed to {GapLength}) even matters. We describe a new tool, {EULER}-{USR}, for assembling mate-paired short reads and use it to analyze the question of whether the read length matters. We further complement the ongoing experimental efforts to maximize read length by a new computational approach for increasing the effective read length. While the common practice is to trim the error-prone tails of the reads, we present an approach that substitutes trimming with error correction using repeat graphs. An important and counterintuitive implication of this result is that one may extend sequencing reactions that degrade with length "past their prime" to where the error rate grows above what is normally acceptable for fragment assembly.},

	abstract = {Deuterostome animals exhibit widely divergent body plans. Echinoderms have either radial or bilateral symmetry, hemichordates include bilateral enteropneust worms and colonial pterobranchs, and chordates possess a defined dorsal-ventral axis imposed on their anterior-posterior axis. Tunicates are chordates only as larvae, following metamorphosis the adults acquire a body plan unique for the deuterostomes. This paper examines larval and adult body plans in the deuterostomes and discusses two distinct ways of evolving divergent body plans. First, echinoderms and hemichordates have similar feeding larvae, but build a new adult body within or around their larvae. In hemichordates and many direct-developing echinoderms, the adult is built onto the larva, with the larval axes becoming the adult axes and the larval mouth becoming the adult mouth. In contrast, indirect-developing echinoderms undergo radical metamorphosis where adult axes are not the same as larval axes. A second way of evolving a divergent body plan is to become colonial, as seen in hemichordates and tunicates. Early embryonic development and gastrulation are similar in all deuterostomes, but, in chordates, the anterior-posterior axis is established at right angles to the animal-vegetal axis, in contrast to hemichordates and indirect-developing echinoderms. Hox gene sequences and anterior-posterior expression patterns illuminate deuterostome phylogenetic relationships and the evolution of unique adult body plans within monophyletic groups. Many genes that are considered vertebrate 'mesodermal' genes, such as nodal and brachyury T, are likely to ancestrally have been involved in the formation of the mouth and anus, and later were evolutionarily co-opted into mesoderm during vertebrate development.},

	abstract = {Ascidians or sea squirts form a diverse group within chordates, which includes a few thousand members of marine sessile filter-feeding animals. Their mitochondrial genomes are characterized by particularly high evolutionary rates and rampant gene rearrangements. This extreme variability complicates standard polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) based techniques for molecular characterization studies, and consequently only a few complete Ascidian mitochondrial genome sequences are available. Using the standard {PCR} and Sanger sequencing approach, we produced the mitochondrial genome of Ascidiella aspersa only after a great effort. In contrast, we produced five additional mitogenomes (Botrylloides aff. leachii, Halocynthia spinosa, Polycarpa mytiligera, Pyura gangelion, and Rhodosoma turcicum) with a novel strategy, consisting in sequencing the pooled total {DNA} samples of these five species using one Illumina {HiSeq} 2000 flow cell lane. Each mitogenome was efficiently assembled in a single contig using de novo transcriptome assembly, as de novo genome assembly generally performed poorly for this task. Each of the new six mitogenomes presents a different and novel gene order, showing that no syntenic block has been conserved at the ordinal level (in Stolidobranchia and in Phlebobranchia). Phylogenetic analyses support the paraphyly of both Ascidiacea and Phlebobranchia, with Thaliacea nested inside Phlebobranchia, although the deepest nodes of the Phlebobranchia-Thaliacea clade are not well resolved. The strategy described here thus provides a cost-effective approach to obtain complete mitogenomes characterized by a highly plastic gene order and a fast nucleotide/amino acid substitution rate.},

Embryos and adults are transparent and consist of a small number of cells. The anatomy of juveniles and adults has been described in detail. Cleavage pattern, cell lineages, and morphogenetic movements during embryogenesis have also been comprehensively documented. A draft genome sequence is now available. These features make this organism a suitable experimental model animal in which genetic manipulations would be feasible, as in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: The notochord is a defining feature of the chordate clade, and invertebrate chordates, such as tunicates, are uniquely suited for studies of this structure. Here we used a well-characterized set of 50 notochord genes known to be targets of the notochord-specific Brachyury transcription factor in one tunicate, Ciona intestinalis (Class: Ascidiacea) to begin determining whether the same genetic toolkit is employed to build the notochord in another tunicate, Oikopleura dioica (Class: Larvacea). We identified Oikopleura orthologs of the Ciona notochord genes, as well as lineage-specific duplicates for which we determined the phylogenetic relationships with related genes from other chordates and we analyzed their expression patterns in Oikopleura embryos. {RESULTS}: Of the 50 Ciona notochord genes that were used as a reference, only 26 had clearly identifiable orthologs in Oikopleura. Two of these conserved genes appeared to have undergone Oikopleura- and/or tunicate-specific duplications, and one was present in three copies in Oikopleura, thus bringing the number of genes to test to 30. We were able to clone and test 28 of these genes. Thirteen of the 28 Oikopleura orthologs of Ciona notochord genes showed clear expression in all or in part of the Oikopleura notochord, seven were diffusely expressed throughout the tail, six were expressed in tissues other than the notochord, while two probes did not provide a detectable signal at any of the stages analyzed. One of the notochord genes identified, Oikopleura netrin, was found to be unevenly expressed in notochord cells, in a pattern reminiscent of that previously observed for one of the Oikopleura Hox genes. {CONCLUSIONS}: A surprisingly high number of Ciona notochord genes do not have apparent counterparts in Oikopleura, and only a fraction of the evolutionarily conserved genes show clear notochord expression. This suggests that Ciona and Oikopleura, despite the morphological similarities of their notochords, have developed rather divergent sets of notochord genes after their split from a common tunicate ancestor. This study demonstrates that comparisons between divergent tunicates can lead to insights into the basic complement of genes sufficient for notochord development, and elucidate the constraints that control its composition.},

In the present study, we examined the role of {FGF} in these interactions by disrupting signaling using the dominant negative form of the {FGF} receptor. An {FGF} receptor gene of H. roretzi ({HrFGFR}) is expressed both maternally and zygotically. The maternally expressed transcript was ubiquitously distributed in fertilized eggs and in early embryos. Zygotic expression became evident by the neurula stage and transcripts were detected in epidermal cells of the posterior half of embryos. Synthetic {mRNA} for the dominant negative form of {FGFR}, in which the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain was deleted, was injected into fertilized eggs to interfere with the possible function of {HRFGFR}: Injected eggs cleaved and gastrulated the same as the control embryos. Analyses of the expression of differentiation markers in the experimental embryos indicated that the differentiation of epidermal cells, muscle cells and endodermal cells was not affected significantly. However, manipulated embryos showed downregulation of notochord-specific Brachyury expression and failure of notochord cell differentiation, resulting in the development of tailbud embryos with shorted tails. The expression of an actin gene that is normally expressed in mesenchyme cells was also suppressed. These results suggest that {FGF} signals are involved in differentiation of notochord cells and mesenchyme cells in Halocynthia embryos. Furthermore, the patterning of a neuron-specific tubulin gene expression was disturbed, suggesting that the formation of the nervous system was directly affected by disrupting {FGF} signals or indirectly affected due to the disruption of normal notochord formation.},

Fiber-wound, hydraulic mechanisms of elongation highlight the importance of biomechanical linkages of otherwise unrelated cellular behaviors during elongation. Little-studied examples of elongation by cell intercalation offer opportunities to study new aspects of this mode of elongation. Elongation by oriented cell division highlights the problem of mitotic spindle orientation and the maintenance of cell-packing patterns in anisotropic force environments. The balance of internal cell-adhesion and external traction forces emerges as a key issue in the formation of elongate structures from compact ones by directed migration.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Molecular evolutionary studies of noncoding sequences rely on multiple alignments. Yet how multiple alignment accuracy varies across sequence types, tree topologies, divergences and tools, and further how this variation impacts specific inferences, remains unclear. {RESULTS}: Here we develop a molecular evolution simulation platform, {CisEvolver}, with models of background noncoding and transcription factor binding site evolution, and use simulated alignments to systematically examine multiple alignment accuracy and its impact on two key molecular evolutionary inferences: transcription factor binding site conservation and divergence estimation. We find that the accuracy of multiple alignments is determined almost exclusively by the pairwise divergence distance of the two most diverged species and that additional species have a negligible influence on alignment accuracy. Conserved transcription factor binding sites align better than surrounding noncoding {DNA} yet are often found to be misaligned at relatively short divergence distances, such that studies of binding site gain and loss could easily be confounded by alignment error. Divergence estimates from multiple alignments tend to be overestimated at short divergence distances but reach a tool specific divergence at which they cease to increase, leading to underestimation at long divergences. Our most striking finding was that overall alignment accuracy, binding site alignment accuracy and divergence estimation accuracy vary greatly across branches in a tree and are most accurate for terminal branches connecting sister taxa and least accurate for internal branches connecting sub-alignments. {CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that variation in alignment accuracy can lead to errors in molecular evolutionary inferences that could be construed as biological variation. These findings have implications for which species to choose for analyses, what kind of errors would be expected for a given set of species and how multiple alignment tools and phylogenetic inference methods might be improved to minimize or control for alignment errors.},

Ascidians show mosaic development; such autonomous development has been taken as evidence that prelocalized ooplasmic factors specify tissue precursor cells during embryogenesis. Interest has been concentrated on the mechanisms underlying the formation of muscle cells in the tail, as yellow-coloured myoplasm in eggs is preferentially segregated into muscle-lineage blastomeres. Here we show that maternal messenger {RNA} of the macho-1 gene is a determinant of muscle fate in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. The macho-1 {mRNA} encodes a zinc-finger protein, and the {mRNA} is localized to the myoplasm of eggs. Depletion of the {mRNA} specifically resulted in the loss of primary muscle cells in the tail, as shown by the expression of muscle-specific molecular markers. The myoplasm of macho-1-deficient eggs lost its ability to promote muscle formation. Injection of synthesized macho-1 {mRNA} caused ectopic muscle formation in non-muscle-lineage cells. Our results indicate that macho-1 maybe both required and sufficient for specification of muscle fate, and that the {mRNA} is a genuine, localized muscle determinant.},

Sequencing and assembling the transcriptome of P. chalceus is a first step in developing large scale genetic information that will allow us to further study the recurrent phenotypic evolution in dispersal traits in these natural populations.Methodology/{ResultsWe} used the Illumina {HiSeq}2000 to sequence 37 Gbases of the transcriptome and performed de novo transcriptome assembly with the Trinity short read assembler. This resulted in 65,766 contigs, clustering into 39,393 unique transcripts (unigenes). A subset of 12,987 show similarity ({BLAST}) to known proteins in the {NCBI} database and 7,589 are assigned Gene Ontology ({GO}). Using homology searches we identified all reported genes involved in wing development, juvenile- and ecdysteroid hormone pathways in Tribolium castaneum. About half (56.7\%) of the unique assembled genes are shared among three life stages (third-instar larva, pupa, and imago). We identified 38,141 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in these unigenes. Of these {SNPs}, 26,823 (70.3\%) were found in a predicted open reading frame ({ORF}) and 6,998 (18.3\%) were nonsynonymous.{ConclusionsThe} assembled transcriptome and {SNP} data are essential genomic resources for further study of the developmental pathways, genetic mechanisms and metabolic consequences of adaptive divergence in dispersal power in natural populations.},

	abstract = {The phylogeny of the Tunicata was reconstructed using molecular and morphological characters. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) and 18S {rDNA} sequences were obtained for 14 and 4 tunicate species, respectively. 18S {rDNA} sequences were aligned with gene sequences obtained from {GenBank} of 57 tunicates, a cephalochordate, and a selachian craniate. Cox1 sequences were aligned with the sequence of two ascidians and a cephalochordate obtained from {GenBank}. Traditional, morphological, life history, and biochemical characters of larval and adult stages were compiled from the literature and analyzed cladistically. Separate and simultaneous parsimony analyses of molecular and morphological data were carried out. Aplousobranch ascidians from three different families were included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis for the first time. Analysis of the morphological, life history, and biochemical characters results in a highly unresolved tree. Aplousobranchiata form a strongly supported monophylum in the analysis of the 18S {rDNA} data, the morphological data, and the combined data set. Cionidae is not included in the Aplousobranchiata but nests within the Phlebobranchiata. Appendicularia (=Larvacea) nest within the 'Ascidiacea' as the sister taxon of Aplousobranchiata in the parsimony analysis of the 18S {rDNA} data and the combined analysis. A potential morphological synapomorphy of Aplousobranchiata plus Appendicularia is the horizontal orientation of the larval tail. In the 18S {rDNA} and the combined analysis, Thaliacea is included in the 'Ascidiacea' as the sister group to Phlebobranchiata. Pyrosomatida is found to be the sister taxon to the Salpidae in analyses of 18S {rDNA} and combined data, whereas the analysis of the morphological data recovers a sister group relationship between Doliolidae and Salpidae. Results of cox1 analyses are incongruent with both the 18S {rDNA} and the morphological phylogenies. Cox1 sequences may evolve too rapidly to resolve relationships of higher tunicate taxa. However, the cox1 data may be useful at lower taxonomic levels.},

While expression analysis has uncovered large numbers of de-regulated genes in cells with altered Hox activity, determining which are direct versus indirect targets has remained a significant challenge. Here, we characterize the {DNA} binding activity of Hox transcription factor complexes on eight experimentally verified cis-regulatory elements. Hox factors regulate the activity of each element by forming protein complexes with two cofactor proteins, Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth). Using comparative {DNA} binding assays, we found that a number of flexible arrangements of Hox, Exd, and Hth binding sites mediate cooperative transcription factor complexes. Moreover, analysis of a Distal-less regulatory element ({DMXR}) that is repressed by abdominal Hox factors revealed that suboptimal binding sites can be combined to form high affinity transcription complexes. Lastly, we determined that the anterior Hox factors are more dependent upon Exd and Hth for complex formation than posterior Hox factors. Based upon these findings, we suggest a general set of guidelines to serve as a basis for designing bioinformatics algorithms aimed at identifying Hox regulatory elements using the wealth of recently sequenced genomes.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the mechanism of an evolutionary change in ascidian muscle cell differentiation. The ascidians Molgula oculata and Molgula occulta are closely related species with different modes of development. M. oculata embryos develop into conventional tadpole larvae with a tail containing striated muscle cells, whereas M. occulta embryos develop into tailless larvae with undifferentiated vestigial muscle cells. The muscle actin gene {MocuMA}1 was isolated from an M. oculata genomic library. {MocuMA}1 is a single-copy, larval-type muscle actin gene which appears to lack introns. However, the 5' upstream region of {MocuMA}1 is sufficient to drive expression of a {lacZ} fusion construct in the larval muscle cells, implying that it is a functional gene. {MocuMA}1 {mRNA} first appears in the prospective muscle cells of M. oculata embryos during gastrulation, and transcripts continue to be present throughout embryogenesis. Muscle actin {mRNA} was not detected during M. occulta embryogenesis, although the same probe was capable of detecting muscle actin {mRNA} in more distantly related ascidian species with tail muscle cells. Interspecific hybrids produced by fertilizing M. occulta eggs with M. oculata sperm recover the ability to express muscle actin {mRNA} in the vestigial muscle cells, suggesting that trans-acting factors responsible for muscle actin gene expression are conserved in M. occulta. The presence of these trans-acting factors was confirmed by showing that the {MocuMA}1/{lacZ} fusion construct is expressed in the vestigial muscle cells of M. occulta larvae. The orthologous larval muscle actin genes {MoccMA}1a and {MoccMA}1b were isolated from a M. occulta genomic library. The coding regions of these genes contain deletions, insertions, and codon substitutions that would make their products nonfunctional. Although the 5' upstream regions of the M. occulta muscle actin genes also contain numerous changes, expression of {MoccMA}1a/{lacZ} and {MoccMA}1b/{lacZ} fusion constructs showed that they both retain specific promoter activity, although it is reduced in {MoccMAlb}. The results suggest that the regression of muscle cell differentiation is mediated by changes in the structure of muscle actin genes rather than in the trans-acting regulatory factors required for their expression.},

	abstract = {The Brachyury, or T, gene is required for notochord development in animals occupying all three chordate subphyla and probably also had this role in the last common ancestor of the chordate lineages. In two chordate subphyla (vertebrates and cephalochordates), T is also expressed during gastrulation in involuting endodermal and mesodermal cells, and in vertebrates at least, this expression domain is required for proper development. In the basally diverging chordate subphylum Urochordata, animals in the class Ascidiacea do not employ T during gastrulation in endodermal or nonaxial mesodermal cells, and it has been suggested that nonnotochordal roles for T were acquired in the cephalochordate–vertebrate lineage after it split with Urochordata. To test this hypothesis, we cloned T from Oikopleura dioica, a member of the urochordate class Appendicularia (or Larvacea), which diverged basally in the subphylum. Investigation of the expression pattern in developing Oikopleura embryos showed early expression in presumptive notochord precursor cells, in the notochord, and in parts of the developing gut and cells of the endodermal strand. We conclude that the ancestral role of T likely included expression in the developing gut and became necessary in chordates for construction of the notochord.},

	abstract = {A {MyoD} family gene was identified in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and designated {CiMDF} (Ciona intestinalis Muscle Determination Factor). Expression of {CiMDF} was restricted to the muscle cells of the developing embryo and the body-wall muscle of adults. Northern blots showed that two differentially regulated {CiMDF} transcripts were expressed during development. A 1.8 kb transcript ({CiMDFa}) appeared first and was gradually replaced by a 2.7 kb transcript ({CiMDFb}). These transcripts encoded essentially identical {MyoD} family proteins with the exception of a 68 amino acid C-terminal sequence present in {CiMDFb} that was absent from {CiMDFa}. Although both {CiMDFa} and {CiMDFb} contained the cysteine-rich/basic-helix loop helix domain (Cys-rich/{bHLH}) present in all {MyoD} family proteins, only {CiMDFb} contained the region near the C terminus (Domain {III}) characteristic of this gene family. Genomic Southern blots showed that C. intestinalis has only one {MyoD} family gene, suggesting that {CiMDFa} and {CiMDFb} result from differential processing of primary transcripts. The existence of two {MyoD} family proteins that are differentially expressed during ascidian embryogenesis has novel parallels to vertebrate muscle development and may reflect conserved myogenic regulatory mechanisms among chordates.},

	abstract = {Decoding transcriptional programs governing transcriptomic diversity across human multiple tissues is a major challenge in bioinformatics. To address this problem, a number of computational methods have focused on cis-regulatory codes driving overexpression or underexpression in a single tissue as compared to others. On the other hand, we recently proposed a different approach to mine cis-regulatory codes: starting from gene sets sharing common cis-regulatory motifs, the method screens for expression modules based on expression coherence. However, both approaches seem to be insufficient to capture transcriptional programs that control gene expression in a subset of all samples. Especially, this limitation would be serious when analyzing multiple tissue data. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new module discovery method termed {BEEM} (Biclusering-based Extraction of Expression Modules) in order to discover expression modules that are functional in a subset of tissues. We showed that, when applied to expression profiles of human multiple tissues, {BEEM} finds expression modules missed by two existing approaches that are based on the coherent expression and the single tissue-specific differential expression. From the {BEEM} results, we obtained new insights into transcriptional programs controlling transcriptomic diversity across various types of tissues. This study introduces {BEEM} as a powerful tool for decoding regulatory programs from a compendium of gene expression profiles.},

	abstract = {Metamorphosis displays a striking diversity in chordates, a deuterostome phylum that comprises vertebrates, urochordates (tunicates), and cephalochordates (amphioxus). In anuran amphibians, the tadpole loses its tail, develops limbs, and undergoes profound changes at the behavioral, physiological, biochemical, and ecological levels. In ascidian tunicates, the tail is lost and the head tissues are drastically remodeled into the adult animal, whereas in amphioxus, the highly asymmetric larva transforms into a relatively symmetric adult. This wide diversity has led to the proposal that metamorphosis evolved several times independently in the different chordate lineages during evolution. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in metamorphosis are largely unknown outside amphibians and teleost fishes, in which metamorphosis is regulated by the thyroid hormones ({TH}) T3 and T4 binding to their receptors (thyroid hormone receptors). In this review, we compare metamorphosis in chordates and then propose a unifying definition of the larva-to-adult transition, based on the conservation of the role of {THs} and some of their derivatives as the main regulators of metamorphosis. According to this definition, all chordates (if not, all deuterostomes) have a homologous metamorphosis stage during their postembryonic development. The intensity and the nature of the morphological remodeling varies extensively among taxa, from drastic remodeling like in some ascidians or amphibians to more subtle events, as in mammals.},

The emergence of the chordate body plan: some puzzles and problems. -Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91: 4-10Rather than being sessile filter feeders, ancestral chordates are now thought to have evolved from more active benthic animals, possibly hemichordate-like, that took to swimming, to generate something resembling modern amphioxus. This general picture conceals a number of specific problems that underline how little we understand the transition in detail. I will address three. First, and closest to resolution is the issue of dorsoventral inversion, which has implications for understanding how an internalized brain evolved. This is because the mouth, dorsal after inversion, has first to be moved out of the way. Its migration down the left side of the head during amphioxus development may be a recapitulation of this event. Two other puzzles, both further from resolution are: (1) the significance, if any, of the neurenteric canal, which may be telling us something important about the true nature of deuterostomy, specifically whether hemichordates and echinoderms are deuterostomes for a different reason than chordates, and (2) whether the functional digestive tract of chordates is a secondary replacement of an earlier structure whose fate remains unexplained. Resolving these latter two issues will require a better understanding of molecular level events during development in protochordates and their immediate invertebrate relatives.},

In contrast to all bilaterians studied so far, Hox genes are not clustered in the Oikopleura genome. Their expression occurs mostly in the tail, with some tissue preference, and a strong partition of expression domains in the nerve cord, in the notochord and in the muscle. In each tissue of the tail, the anteroposterior order of Hox gene expression evokes spatial collinearity, with several alterations.

For each putative target gene we fit a simple differential equation model of transcriptional regulation, and the model likelihood serves as a score to rank targets. The expression profile of the {TF} is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process prior distribution that is integrated out using a nonparametric Bayesian procedure. This results in a parsimonious model with relatively few parameters that can be applied to short time series datasets without noticeable overfitting. We assess our method using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}-chip) and loss-of-function mutant expression data for two {TFs}, Twist, and Mef2, controlling mesoderm development in Drosophila. Lists of top-ranked genes identified by our method are significantly enriched for genes close to bound regions identified in the {ChIP}-chip data and for genes that are differentially expressed in loss-of-function mutants. Targets of Twist display diverse expression profiles, and in this case a model-based approach performs significantly better than scoring based on correlation with {TF} expression. Our approach is found to be comparable or superior to ranking based on mutant differential expression scores. Also, we show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial expression data can further improve target ranking performance.},

Phila. 13, 1], in particular, led to the idea that the developmental program of these animals was driven by the cell-autonomous inheritance of localised maternal determinants, rendered precise by the stereotyped pattern of invariant cell cleavages. Work in the past 20 years indeed identified several localised maternal determinants of the position of cleavage planes or of some early cell fates. The overwhelming majority of cells in the three germ layers, however, do not follow a cell-autonomous differentiation program. Instead, they respond to short-range signals, as described in this review. Careful analysis of cell-cell contacts suggests that a major function of the invariant position of cleavage plans, besides segregating competence factors, is to control the relative positions of inducing cells and those competent to respond. Surprisingly, while the cell lineage is very well conserved between the divergent species Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis, the molecular nature of inducing signals can vary. The constraints on embryo anatomy thus appear stronger than those on the choice of individual regulatory molecules.},

Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study {mRNA} expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney {RNA} samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same {RNA} samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each {mRNA} sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer-associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue-specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome-wide scale.},

Impaired reading of alphabetic scripts is associated with dysfunction of left temporoparietal brain regions. These regions perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units of speech (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system). Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning orthography-to-semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is dependent on culture.},

	abstract = {The notochord has two major roles during chordate embryogenesis, as a source of inductive signals for the patterning of neural tube and paraxial mesoderm and as a supportive organ of the larval tail. Despite the recent identification of mutations that affect the notochord development in vertebrate embryos, little is known about genes that are expressed in the differentiating notochord itself. In the urochordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury (Ci-Bra) plays a key role in notochord differentiation. In a previous study, we isolated {cDNA} clones for nearly 40 potential Ci-Bra target genes that are expressed in notochord cells (H. Takahashi et al., 1999, Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). Here we characterized 20 of them by determining the complete nucleotide sequences of the {cDNAs}. These genes encode a broad spectrum of divergent proteins associated with notochord formation and function. Two genes encode ascidian homologs of the Drosophila Prickle {LIM} domain proteins and another encodes the {ERM} protein, all 3 of which appear to be involved in the control of cytoskeletal architecture. In addition, genes for netrin, leprecan, cdc45, {ATP}:citrate lyase, {ATP} sulfurylase/{APS} kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase, beta4-galactosyltransferase, fibrinogen-like protein, divergent tropomyosin-like proteins, and Drosophila Pellino-like protein were identified. The observation of the netrin gene expression in the notochord may provide the first molecular evidence that the ascidian notochord is a source of signals as in vertebrates. In addition, the present information should be used to identify nonchordate deuterostome tissues homologous to the notochord as well as genes which are expressed in the notochord cells of vertebrate embryos.},

Both cis- and trans-regulatory changes contribute to divergent gene expression, but their respective contributions remain largely unknown. Here we examine the distribution of cis- and trans-regulatory changes underlying expression differences between closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and show functional cis-regulatory differences by comparing the relative abundance of species-specific transcripts in F1 hybrids. Differences in trans-regulatory activity were inferred by comparing the ratio of allelic expression in hybrids with the ratio of gene expression between species. Of 29 genes with interspecific expression differences, 28 had differences in cis-regulation, and these changes were sufficient to explain expression divergence for about half of the genes. Trans-regulatory differences affected 55\% (16 of 29) of genes, and were always accompanied by cis-regulatory changes. These data indicate that interspecific expression differences are not caused by select trans-regulatory changes with widespread effects, but rather by many cis-acting changes spread throughout the genome.},

However, our understanding of {NCC} development in human embryos remains largely uncharacterized, despite the role the neural crest plays in several human pathologies. Here, we report for the first time the expression of a battery of molecular markers before, during, or following {NCC} migration in human embryos from Carnegie Stages ({CS}) 12 to 18. Our work demonstrates the expression of Sox9, Sox10 and Pax3 transcription factors in premigratory {NCCs}, while actively migrating {NCCs} display the additional transcription factors Pax7 and {AP}-2alpha. Importantly, while {HNK}-1 labels few migrating {NCCs}, p75({NTR}) labels a large proportion of this population. However, the broad expression of p75({NTR}) - and other markers - beyond the neural crest stresses the need for the identification of additional markers to improve our capacity to investigate human {NCC} development, and to enable the generation of better diagnostic and therapeutic tools.},

Ciona has a small genome, and simple, well-defined embyronic lineages. Here, we examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the notochord. Particular efforts center on the regulation of a notochord-specific Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra). An electroporation method was devised for the efficient incorporation of transgenic {DNA} into Ciona embryos. This method permitted the identification of a minimal, 434 bp enhancer from the Ci-Bra promoter region that mediates the notochord-restricted expression of both {GFP} and {lacZ} reporter genes. This enhancer contains a negative control region that excludes Ci-Bra expression from inappropriate embryonic lineages, including the trunk mesenchyme and tail muscles. Evidence is presented that the enhancer is activated by a regulatory element which is closely related to the recognition sequence of the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor, thereby raising the possibility that the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in notochord differentiation. We discuss the implications of this analysis with regard to the evolutionary conservation of integrative enhancers, and the subdivision of the axial and paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates.},

	abstract = {The identification of regulatory sequences in animal genomes remains a significant challenge. Comparative genomic methods that use patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify non-coding sequences with regulatory function have yielded many new vertebrate enhancers. However, these methods have not contributed significantly to the identification of regulatory sequences in sequenced invertebrate taxa. We demonstrate here that this differential success, which is often attributed to fundamental differences in the nature of vertebrate and invertebrate regulatory sequences, is instead primarily a product of the relatively small size of sequenced invertebrate genomes. We sequenced and compared loci involved in early embryonic patterning from four species of true fruit flies (family Tephritidae) that have genomes four to six times larger than those of Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike in Drosophila, where virtually all non-coding {DNA} is highly conserved, blocks of conserved non-coding sequence in tephritids are flanked by large stretches of poorly conserved sequence, similar to what is observed in vertebrate genomes. We tested the activities of nine conserved non-coding sequences flanking the even-skipped gene of the teprhitid Ceratis capitata in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos, six of which drove patterns that recapitulate those of known D. melanogaster enhancers. In contrast, none of the three non-conserved tephritid non-coding sequences that we tested drove expression in D. melanogaster embryos. Based on the landscape of non-coding conservation in tephritids, and our initial success in using conservation in tephritids to identify D. melanogaster regulatory sequences, we suggest that comparison of tephritid genomes may provide a systematic means to annotate the non-coding portion of the D. melanogaster genome. We also propose that large genomes be given more consideration in the selection of species for comparative genomics projects, to provide increased power to detect functional non-coding {DNAs} and to provide a less biased view of the evolution and function of animal genomes.},

Gene expression is restricted to notochord precursor cells, and Ci-Bra plays a key role in notochord differentiation. In a previous study, nearly 50 {cDNA} clones for potential Ci-Bra-downstream genes that are expressed in notochord cells were isolated. The present determination, by whole-mount in situ hybridization, of the temporal expression patterns of 19 notochord-specific and 20 notochord-predominant genes demonstrated that the timings of initiation of the expression of various genes was not identical. The expression of several genes was initiated as early as the gastrula stage. However, the expression of most of the notochord-specific genes commenced at the neural plate stage. Partial nucleotide sequence data of these clones suggest that genes expressed earlier encode potential transcriptional factors and/or nuclear proteins, while those expressed later encode proteins implicated in cell adhesion, signal transduction, regulation of the cytoskeleton, and components of the extracellular matrix. These gene activities may be associated with changes in cell shape and adhesion during the intercalation and extension of the notochord cells.},

We have studied differences in regulation of the neural crest marker {AP}-2 across two evolutionary transitions: invertebrate to vertebrate, and agnathan to gnathostome. Isolation and comparison of amphioxus, lamprey and axolotl {AP}-2 reveals its extensive expansion in the vertebrate dorsal neural tube and pharyngeal arches, implying co-option of {AP}-2 genes by neural crest cells early in vertebrate evolution. Expression in non-neural ectoderm is a conserved feature in amphioxus and vertebrates, suggesting an ancient role for {AP}-2 genes in this tissue. There is also common expression in subsets of ventrolateral neurons in the anterior neural tube, consistent with a primitive role in brain development. Comparison of {AP}-2 expression in axolotl and lamprey suggests an elaboration of cranial neural crest patterning in gnathostomes. However, migration of {AP}-2-expressing neural crest cells medial to the pharyngeal arch mesoderm appears to be a primitive feature retained in all vertebrates. Because {AP}-2 has essential roles in cranial neural crest differentiation and proliferation, the co-option of {AP}-2 by neural crest cells in the vertebrate lineage was a potentially crucial event in vertebrate evolution.},

This raises the intriguing possibility that precursors are actively maintained by epigenetic influences in a stem cell-like state. Accordingly, we report that dynamic histone modifications are critical for proper temporal control of neural crest gene expression in vivo. The histone demethylase, {JumonjiD}2A ({JmjD}2A/{KDM}4A), is expressed in the forming neural folds. Loss of {JmjD}2A function causes dramatic downregulation of neural crest specifier genes analyzed by multiplex {NanoString} and in situ hybridization. Importantly, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals direct stage-specific interactions of {JmjD}2A with regulatory regions of neural crest genes, and associated temporal modifications in methylation states of lysine residues directly affected by {JmjD}2A activity. Our findings show that chromatin modifications directly control neural crest genes in vertebrate embryos via modulating histone methylation.},

These invertebrates include the cephalochordates and tunicates, whose larvae share with vertebrate embryos a common body plan with a central notochord and a dorsal nerve cord. Tunicates are now thought to be the sister group of vertebrates. However, research based on several species of ascidians, a diverse and wide-spread class of tunicates, revealed that the molecular strategies underlying their development appear to diverge greatly from those found in vertebrates. Furthermore, the adult body plan of most tunicates, which arises following an extensive post-larval metamorphosis, shows little resemblance to the body plan of any other chordate. In this review, we compare the developmental strategies of ascidians and vertebrates and argue that the very divergence of these strategies reveals the surprising level of plasticity of the chordate developmental program and is a rich resource to identify core regulatory mechanisms that are evolutionarily conserved in chordates. Further, we propose that the comparative analysis of the architecture of ascidian and vertebrate gene regulatory networks may provide critical insight into the origin of the chordate body plan.},

In addition to its 12 previously identified protein-binding sites, sparkling is densely populated with previously unmapped regulatory sequences, which interact in complex ways to control gene expression. One segment is essential for activation at a distance, yet dispensable for other activation functions and for cell type patterning. Unexpectedly, rearranging sparkling's regulatory sites converts it into a robust photoreceptor-specific enhancer. Our results show that a single combination of regulatory inputs can encode multiple outputs, and suggest that the enhancer's organization determines the correct expression pattern by facilitating certain short-range regulatory interactions at the expense of others.},

However, phylogenomic and comparative genomic studies have also suggested that tunicates are characterized by an elevated rate of molecular evolution and a high degree of genomic divergence. Despite the recurrent interest in the group, the picture of tunicate peculiar evolutionary dynamics is still fragmentary, as it mainly lies in studies focusing on only a few model species. In order to expand the available genomic data for the group, we used the high-throughput 454 technology to sequence the partial transcriptome of a previously unsampled tunicate, Microcosmus squamiger. This allowed us to get further insights into tunicate-accelerated evolution through a comparative analysis based on pertinent phylogenetic markers, i.e., a core of 35 housekeeping genes conserved across bilaterians. Our results showed that tunicates evolved on average about two times faster than the other chordates, yet the degree of this acceleration varied extensively upon genes and upon lineages. Appendicularia and Aplousobranchia were detected as the most divergent groups which were also characterized by highly heterogeneous substitution rates across genes. Finally, an estimation of the d (N)/d (S) ratio in three pairs of closely related taxa within Olfactores did not reveal strong differences between the tunicate and vertebrate lineages suggesting that for this set of housekeeping genes, the accelerated evolution of tunicates is plausibly due to an elevated mutation rate rather than to particular selective effects.},

The origin of novel homeobox genes is thought to have contributed to many evolutionary innovations in animals. We perform a molecular phylogenetic analysis of cnox2, the best studied homeobox gene from the phylum Cnidaria, a very ancient lineage of animals. Among three competing hypotheses, our analysis decisively favors the hypothesis that cnox2 is orthologous to the gsx gene of Bilateria, thereby establishing the existence of this specific homeobox gene in the eumetazoan stem lineage, some 650-900 million years ago. We assayed the expression of gsx in the planula larva and polyp of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis using in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The gsx ortholog of Nematostella, known as anthox2, is expressed at high levels in the posterior planula and the corresponding "head" region of the polyp. It cannot be detected in the anterior planula or the corresponding "foot" region of the polyp. We have attempted to reconstruct the evolution of gsx spatiotemporal expression in cnidarians and bilaterians using a phylogenetic framework. Because of the surprisingly high degree of variability in gsx expression within the Cnidaria, it is currently not possible to infer unambiguously the ancestral cnidarian condition or the ancestral eumetazoan condition for gsx expression.},

	abstract = {The discovery of the organizer by Spemann and Mangold in 1924 raised two kinds of questions: those about the means of patterning the chordate body axis and those about the mechanisms of cell determination by induction. Some researchers, stressing the second, have suggested over the years that the organizer is poorly named and doesn't really organize because inducers act permissively, because they are not unique to the organizer, and because multipotent responsive cells develop complex local differentiations under artificial conditions. Furthermore, with the discovery of meso-endoderm induction in 1969, the possibility arose that this earlier induction generates as much organization as, or more than, does the organizer itself. Evidence is summarized in this article that the organizer does fulfill its title with regard to pattern formation: it adds greatly to embryonic organization by providing information about time, place, scale, and orientation for development by nearby members of the large multipotent competence groups surrounding the organizer. Embryos having smaller or larger organizers due to experimental intervention develop defective axial organization. Without an organizer the embryo develops no body axis and none of the four chordate characters: the notochord, gill slits, dorsal hollow nerve chord, and post-anal tail. For normal axis formation, the organizer's tripartite organization is needed. Each part differs in inducers, morphogenesis, and self-differentiation. The organizer is a trait of development of all members of the chordate phylum. In comparison to hemichordates, which constitute a phylum with some similarities to chordates, the chordamesoderm part is unique to the chordate organizer (the trunk-tail organizer). Its convergent extension displaces the gastrula posterior pole from alignment with the animal-vegetal axis and generates a new anteroposterior axis orthogonal to this old one. Once it has extended to full length, its signaling modifies the dorsoventral dimension. This addition to the organizer is seen as a major event in chordate evolution, bringing body organization beyond that achieved by oocyte organization and meso-endoderm induction in other groups.},

	abstract = {The Manx gene is required for the development of the tail and other chordate features in the ascidian tadpole larva. To determine the structure of the Manx gene, we isolated and sequenced genomic clones from the tailed ascidian Molgula oculata. The Manx gene contains 9 exons and encodes both major and minor Manx {mRNAs}, which differ in the length of their 5' untranslated regions. The coding region of the single-copy bobcat gene, which encodes a {DEAD}-box {RNA} helicase, is embedded within the first Manx intron. The organization of the bobcat and Manx transcription units was determined by comparing genomic and {cDNA} clones. The Manx-bobcat gene locus has an unusual organization in which a non-coding first exon is alternatively spliced at the 5' end of two different {mRNAs}. The bobcat and Manx genes are expressed coordinately during oogenesis and embryogenesis, but not during spermatogenesis, in which bobcat {mRNA} accumulates independently of Manx {mRNA}. Similar to Manx, zygotic bobcat transcripts accumulate in the embryonic primordia responsible for generating chordate features, including the dorsal neural tube and notochord, are downregulated during embryogenesis in the tailless species Molgula occulta and are upregulated in M. occulta X M. oculata hybrids, which restore these chordate features. Antisense experiments indicate that zygotic bobcat expression is required for development of the same suite of chordate features as Manx. The results show that the Manx-bobcat gene complex has a role in the development of chordate features in ascidian tadpole larvae.},

Key components of gastrulation are convergence and extension (C\&E) movements, which narrow and lengthen the embryonic tissues, respectively. The rates of C\&E movements differ significantly according to the position and the stage of gastrulation. Here, we review the distinct cellular behaviors that define the spatial and temporal patterns of C\&E movements, with the special emphasis on zebrafish. We also summarize the molecular regulation of these cellular behaviors and the interplay between different signaling pathways that drive C\&E. Finally, to ensure efficient C\&E movements, cells must achieve mediolaterally-elongated cell morphology and polarize motile protrusions. We discuss the recent discoveries on the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the mediolateral cell polarity is established.},

This prompted us to map the origin of the neural crest and dorsal neural tube in the early avian embryo. Using a combination of focal dye injections and time-lapse imaging, we find that neural crest and dorsal neural tube precursors are present in a broad, crescent-shaped region of the gastrula. Surprisingly, static fate maps together with dynamic confocal imaging reveal that the neural plate border is considerably broader and extends more caudally than expected. Interestingly, we find that the position of the presumptive neural crest broadly correlates with the {BMP}4 expression domain from gastrula to neurula stages. Some degree of rostrocaudal patterning, albeit incomplete, is already evident in the gastrula. Time-lapse imaging studies show that the neural crest and dorsal neural tube precursors undergo choreographed movements that follow a spatiotemporal progression and include convergence and extension, reorientation, cell intermixing, and motility deep within the embryo. Through these rearrangement and reorganization movements, the neural crest and dorsal neural tube precursors become regionally segregated, coming to occupy predictable rostrocaudal positions along the embryonic axis. This regionalization occurs progressively and appears to be complete in the neurula by stage 7 at levels rostral to Hensen's node.},

For each positive enhancer, we provide digital images of whole-mount embryo staining at embryonic day 11.5 and an anatomical description of the reporter gene expression pattern. Users can retrieve elements near single genes of interest, search for enhancers that target reporter gene expression to a particular tissue, or download entire collections of enhancers with a defined tissue specificity or conservation depth.

Here we introduce a memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We show that this data structure accurately represents {DNA} assembly graphs in low memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the overall memory requirements for de novo assembly of metagenomes. On one soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly.},

	abstract = {The spurious (or nonfunctional) binding of transcription factors ({TF}) to the wrong locations on {DNA} presents a formidable challenge to genomes given the relatively low ceiling for sequence complexity within the short lengths of most binding motifs. The high potential for the occurrence of random motifs and subsequent nonfunctional binding of many transcription factors should theoretically lead to natural selection against the occurrence of spurious motif throughout the genome. However, because of the active role that chromatin can influence over eukaryotic gene regulation, it may also be expected that many supposed spurious binding sites could escape purifying selection if (A) they simply occur in regions of high nucleosome occupancy or (B) their surrounding chromatin was dynamically involved in their identity and function. We compared nucleosome occupancy and the presence/absence of functionally conserved chromatin context to the strength of selection against spurious binding of various {TF} binding motifs in Saccharomyces yeast. While we find no direct relationship with nucleosome occupancy, we find strong evidence that transcription factors spatially associated with evolutionarily conserved chromatin states are under relaxed selection against accidental binding. Transcription factors (with/without) a conserved chromatin context were found to occur on average, (87.7\%/49.3\%) of their expected frequencies. Functional binding motifs with conserved chromatin contexts were also significantly shorter in length and more often clustered. These results indicate a role of chromatin context dependency in relaxing selection against spurious binding in nearly half of all {TF} binding motifs throughout the yeast genome.},

Although all {eQTL} studies so far have assayed messenger {RNA} levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in {RNA} sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced {RNA} from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International {HapMap} Project2. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the {HapMap} project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that {eQTLs} near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

De novo assembly of sequence reads generated by classical Sanger capillary sequencing is a mature field of research. Unfortunately, the existing sequence assembly programs were not effective for short sequence reads generated by Illumina and {SOLiD} platforms. Early studies suggested that, in principle, sequence reads as short as 20-30 nucleotides could be used to generate useful assemblies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome sequences, albeit containing many gaps. The early feasibility studies and proofs of principle inspired several bioinformatics research groups to implement new algorithms as freely available software tools specifically aimed at assembling reads of 30-50 nucleotides in length. This has led to the generation of several draft genome sequences based exclusively on short sequence Illumina sequence reads, recently culminating in the assembly of the 2.25-Gb genome of the giant panda from Illumina sequence reads with an average length of just 52 nucleotides. As well as reviewing recent developments in the field, we discuss some practical aspects such as data filtering and submission of assembly data to public repositories.},

	abstract = {The identification of transcription factor binding sites commonly relies on the interpretation of scores generated by a position weight matrix. These scores are presumed to reflect on the affinity of the transcription factor for the bound sequence. In almost all applications, a cutoff score is chosen to distinguish between functional and non-functional binding sites. This cutoff is generally based on statistical rather than biological criteria. Furthermore, given the variety of transcription factors, it is unlikely that the use of a common statistical threshold for all transcription factors is appropriate. In order to incorporate biological information into the choice of cutoff score, we developed a simple evolutionary model that assumes that transcription factor binding sites evolve to maintain an affinity greater than some factor-specific threshold. We then compared patterns of substitution in binding sites predicted by this model at different thresholds to patterns of substitution observed at sites bound in vivo by transcription factors in S. cerevisiae. Assuming that the cutoff value that gives the best fit between the observed and predicted values will optimally distinguish functional and non-functional sites, we discovered substantial heterogeneity for appropriate cutoff values among factors. While commonly used thresholds seem appropriate for many factors, some factors appear to function at cutoffs satisfied commonly in the genome. This evidence was corroborated by local patterns of rate variation for examples of stringent and lenient p-value cutoffs. Our analysis further highlights the necessity of taking a factor-specific approach to binding site identification.},

	abstract = {Recently expanded knowledge of gene regulation clearly indicates that the regulatory sequences of a gene, usually identified as enhancers, are widely distributed in the gene locus, revising the classical view that they are clustered in the vicinity of genes. To identify regulatory sequences for Sox2 expression governing early neurogenesis, we scanned the 50-kb region of the chicken Sox2 locus for enhancer activity utilizing embryo electroporation, resulting in identification of a number of enhancers scattered throughout the analyzed genomic span. The 'pan-neural' Sox2 expression in early embryos is actually brought about by the composite activities of five separate enhancers with distinct spatio-temporal specificities. These and other functionally defined enhancers exactly correspond to extragenic sequence blocks that are conspicuously conserved between the chicken and mammalian genomes and that are embedded in sequences with a wide range of sequence conservation between humans and mice. The sequences conserved between amniotes and teleosts correspond to subregions of the enhancer subsets which presumably represent core motifs of the enhancers, and the limited conservation partly reflects divergent expression patterns of the gene. The phylogenic distance between the chicken and mammals appears optimal for identifying a battery of genetic regulatory elements as conserved sequence blocks, and chicken embryo electroporation facilitates functional characterization of these elements.},

	abstract = {The notochord is a defining feature of the chordate body plan. Experiments in ascidian, frog and mouse embryos have shown that co-expression of Brachyury and {FoxA} class transcription factors is required for notochord development. However, studies on the cis-regulatory sequences mediating the synergistic effects of these transcription factors are complicated by the limited knowledge of notochord genes and cis-regulatory modules ({CRMs}) that are directly targeted by both. We have identified an easily testable model for such investigations in a 155-bp notochord-specific {CRM} from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. This {CRM} contains functional binding sites for both Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and {FoxA} (Ci-{FoxA}-a). By combining point mutation analysis and misexpression experiments, we demonstrate that binding of both transcription factors to this {CRM} is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription. To gain insights into the cis-regulatory criteria controlling its activity, we investigated the organization of the transcription factor binding sites within the 155-bp {CRM}. The 155-bp sequence contains two Ci-Bra binding sites with identical core sequences but opposite orientations, only one of which is required for enhancer activity. Changes in both orientation and spacing of these sites substantially affect the activity of the {CRM}, as clusters of identical sites found in the Ciona genome with different arrangements are unable to activate transcription in notochord cells. This work presents the first evidence of a synergistic interaction between Brachyury and {FoxA} in the activation of an individual notochord {CRM}, and highlights the importance of transcription factor binding site arrangement for its function.},

These programs result from the interpretation of the genomic cis-regulatory information by sequence-specific factors. Decoding this information in sequenced genomes is an important issue. Here, we developed statistical analysis tools to computationally identify the cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression in a set of coregulated genes. Starting with a small number of validated and/or predicted cis-regulatory modules ({CRMs}) in a reference species as a training set, but with no a priori knowledge of the factors acting in trans, we computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites ({TFBSs}) and genomic {CRMs} underlying coregulation. This method was applied to the gene expression program active in Drosophila melanogaster sensory organ precursor cells ({SOPs}), a specific type of neural progenitor cells. Mutational analysis showed that four, including one newly characterized, out of the five top-ranked families of predicted {TFBSs} were required for {SOP}-specific gene expression. Additionaly, 19 out of the 29 top-ranked predicted {CRMs} directed gene expression in neural progenitor cells, i.e., {SOPs} or larval brain neuroblasts, with a notable fraction active in {SOPs} (11/29). We further identified the lola gene as the target of two {SOP}-specific {CRMs} and found that the lola gene contributed to {SOP} specification. The statistics and phylogeny-based tools described here can be more generally applied to identify the cis-regulatory elements of specific gene regulatory networks in any family of related species with sequenced genomes.},

	abstract = {The ascidian notochord forms through simultaneous invagination and convergent extension of a monolayer epithelial plate. Here we combine micromanipulation with time lapse and confocal microscopy to examine how notochord-intrinsic morphogenetic behaviors and interactions with surrounding tissues, determine these global patterns of movement. We show that notochord rudiments isolated at the 64-cell stage divide and become motile with normal timing; but, in the absence of interactions with non-notochordal tissues, they neither invaginate nor converge and extend. We find that notochord formation is robust in the sense that no particular neighboring tissue is required for notochord formation. Basal contact with either neural plate or anterior endoderm/lateral mesenchyme or posterior mesoderm are each alone sufficient to ensure that the notochord plate forms and extends a cylindrical rod. Surprisingly, the axis of convergent extension depends on the specific tissues that contact the notochord, as do other patterns of cell shape change, movement and tissue deformation that accompany notochord formation. We characterize one case in detail, namely, embryos lacking neural plates, in which a normal notochord forms but by an entirely different trajectory. Our results show ascidian notochord formation to be regulative in a fashion and to a degree never before appreciated. They suggest this regulative behavior depends on a complex interplay between morphogenetic tendencies intrinsic to the notochord plate and instructive and permissive interactions with surrounding tissues. We discuss mechanisms that could account for these data and what they imply about notochord morphogenesis and its evolution within the chordate phylum.},

This framework is applied to the recently sequenced genome of the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, making use of the existing knowledge of motifs and gene annotations in another insect genome, that of the fruitfly. The framework uses cross-species comparison to improve the specificity of its predictions, and does so without relying upon non-coding sequence alignment. It is therefore well suited for comparative genomics across large evolutionary divergences, where existing alignment-based methods are not applicable. We also apply the framework to find motifs associated with socially regulated gene sets in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, using comparisons with Nasonia, a solitary species, to identify honeybee-specific associations.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: A feature common to all {DNA} sequencing technologies is the presence of base-call errors in the sequenced reads. The implications of such errors are application specific, ranging from minor informatics nuisances to major problems affecting biological inferences. Recently developed “next-gen” sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of sequencing, but have been shown to be more error prone than previous technologies. Both position specific (depending on the location in the read) and sequence specific (depending on the sequence in the read) errors have been identified in Illumina and Life Technology sequencing platforms. We describe a new type of systematic error that manifests as statistically unlikely accumulations of errors at specific genome (or transcriptome) locations. {RESULTS}: We characterize and describe systematic errors using overlapping paired reads form high-coverage data. We show that such errors occur in approximately 1 in 1000 base pairs, and that they are highly replicable across experiments. We identify motifs that are frequent at systematic error sites, and describe a classifier that distinguishes heterozygous sites from systematic error. Our classifier is designed to accommodate data from experiments in which the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites are not necessarily 0.5 (such as in the case of {RNA}-Seq), and can be used with single-end datasets. {CONCLUSIONS}: Systematic errors can easily be mistaken for heterozygous sites in individuals, or for {SNPs} in population analyses. Systematic errors are particularly problematic in low coverage experiments, or in estimates of allele-specific expression from {RNA}-Seq data. Our characterization of systematic error has allowed us to develop a program, called {SysCall}, for identifying and correcting such errors. We conclude that correction of systematic errors is important to consider in the design and interpretation of high-throughput sequencing experiments.},

We report here that M. tectiformis is another example of a direct developer: their embryonic development is lacking the tadpole larva. The fertilized egg is orange and about 150 μm in diameter. At 18°C, the egg cleaves at about 20 min intervals and gastrulation occurs about 5 hr after fertilization. In contrast to conventionally-developing ascidians, M. tectiformis does not form a tadpole larva. Immediately before hatching, three stolons or ampullae begin to extend from the tailless embryo. After hatching the stolons mediate the attachment of the juvenile body to the substratum. Histochemistry for tissue-specific enzyme activity did not detect muscle-specific acetylcholinesterase, endoderm-specific alkaline phosphatase, and pigment cell-specific tyrosinase. In addition, in situ hybridization could not prove the presence of muscle actin gene transcripts in the embryo. These results suggest that these larval tissues do not differentiate in M. tectiformis embryos. Because M. tectiformis is common and gravid year-around in Otsuchi Bay, this direct developer provides the opportunity for further analysis of molecular changes during evolution that cause an alternative mode of development.},

	abstract = {The neural crest is an embryonic cell population unique to vertebrates. During vertebrate embryogenesis, neural crest cells are first induced from the neural plate border; subsequently, they delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate to their destination, where they differentiate into a wide variety of derivatives. The emergence of the neural crest is thought to be responsible for the evolution of many complex novel structures of vertebrates that are lacking in invertebrate chordates. Despite its central importance in understanding the origin of vertebrates, the evolutionary origin of the neural crest remains elusive. The basal chordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) occupies an outgroup position that is useful for investigating this question. In this review, I summarize recent genomic and comparative developmental studies between amphioxus and vertebrates and discuss their implications for the evolutionary origin of neural crest cells. I focus mainly on the origin of the gene regulatory network underlying neural crest development, and suggest several hypotheses regarding how this network could have been assembled during early vertebrate evolution.},

The {LMP} libraries are an invaluable resource for carrying out complex assemblies and other downstream bioinformatics analyses such as the characterization of structural variants. However, {LMP} libraries are intrinsically noisy and to maximize their value, post-sequencing data analysis is required. Standardizing laboratory protocols and the selection of sequenced reads for downstream analysis are non-trivial tasks. {NextClip} is a tool for analyzing reads from {LMP} libraries, generating a comprehensive quality report and extracting good quality trimmed and deduplicated reads.

We have previously reported weak {DNA} sequence homology between 3' portions of the Antennapedia and fushi tarazu genes of the {ANT}-C and the Ultrabithorax gene of the {BX}-C. Here we show that this {DNA} homology (the homeo box) is due to a conserved protein-coding sequence present in these three pattern-formation genes. Thus the functional homology between these developmental controlling genes is reflected in a structural homology in their gene products. The homeo box sequence is also present in a few copies in the genomes of some other invertebrates, and is even conserved in vertebrate genomes, including the human genome. Apparently at least a part of these developmental switch genes from Drosophila is highly conserved during evolution, and might perform an analogous function in many metazoans .},

A recent study on allele-specific gene expression in hybrids between species of Drosophila revealed cases in which cis- and trans-regulatory elements within species had coevolved in such a way that changes in cis-regulatory elements are compensated by changes in trans-regulatory elements. We hypothesized that such coevolution should often lead to gene misexpression in the hybrid. To test this hypothesis, we estimated allele-specific expression and overall expression levels for 31 genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F1 hybrid. We found that 13 genes with cis-trans compensatory evolution are in fact misexpressed in the hybrid. These represent candidate genes whose dysregulation might be the consequence of coevolution of cis- and trans-regulatory elements within species. Using a mathematical model for the regulation of gene expression, we explored the conditions under which cis-trans compensatory evolution can lead to misexpression in interspecific hybrids.},

We identify over 14,000 putative insulators, including all classically defined insulators. We find two major classes of insulators defined by {dCTCF}/{CP}190/{BEAF}-32 and Su(Hw), respectively. Distributional analyses of insulators revealed that particular sub-classes of insulator elements are excluded between cis-regulatory elements and their target promoters; divide differentially expressed, alternative, and divergent promoters; act as chromatin boundaries; are associated with chromosomal breakpoints among species; and are embedded within active chromatin domains. Together, these results provide a map demarcating the boundaries of gene regulatory units and a framework for understanding insulator function during the development and evolution of Drosophila.},

Most of the blastomeres of these embryos developed more kinds of tissues than have hitherto been reported, and therefore, the developmental fates of each blastomere are more complex. It has been thought that every blastomere of the 64-cell stage ascidian embryo gives rise to only one kind of tissues, but the finding that the several blastomeres at the 32-cell stage developed into at least three different kinds of tissue, clearly indicates that the stage at which the fates of every blastomere are determined to one tissue is later than the 64-cell stage. The results also clearly demonstrate that muscle cells are derived not only from B-line cells (B5.1, B5.2, B6.2, B6.3, and B6.4) but also from A-line cells (A5.2 and A6.4) and b-line cells (b5.3 and b6.5). Based on the present analysis as well as other studies, complete cell lineages of muscle cells up to their terminal differentiation have been proposed. In addition, lineages of nervous system, notochord, and epidermis are also discussed.},

	abstract = {In early Ciona savignyi embryos, nuclear localization of beta-catenin is the first step of endodermal cell specification, and triggers the activation of various target genes. A {cDNA} for Cs-{FGF}4/6/9, a gene activated downstream of beta-catenin signaling, was isolated and shown to encode an {FGF} protein with features of both {FGF}4/6 and {FGF}9/20. The early embryonic expression of Cs-{FGF}4/6/9 was transient and the transcript was seen in endodermal cells at the 16- and 32-cell stages, in notochord and muscle cells at the 64-cell stage, and in nerve cord and muscle cells at the 110-cell stage; the gene was then expressed again in cells of the nervous system after neurulation. When the gene function was suppressed with a specific antisense morpholino oligo, the differentiation of mesenchyme cells was completely blocked, and the fate of presumptive mesenchyme cells appeared to change into that of muscle cells. The inhibition of mesenchyme differentiation was abrogated by coinjection of the morpholino oligo and synthetic Cs-{FGF}4/6/9 {mRNA}. Downregulation of beta-catenin nuclear localization resulted in the absence of mesenchyme cell differentiation due to failure of the formation of signal-producing endodermal cells. Injection of synthetic Cs-{FGF}4/6/9 {mRNA} in beta-catenin-downregulated embryos evoked mesenchyme cell differentiation. These results strongly suggest that Cs-{FGF}4/6/9 produced by endodermal cells acts an inductive signal for the differentiation of mesenchyme cells. On the other hand, the role of Cs-{FGF}4/6/9 in the induction of notochord cells is partial; the initial process of the induction was inhibited by Cs-{FGF}4/6/9 morpholino oligo, but notochord-specific genes were expressed later to form a partial notochord.},

Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development.

	abstract = {The {ANTP} family of homeodomain transcription factors consists of three major groups, the {NKL}, the extended Hox, and the Hox/{ParaHox} family. Hox genes and {ParaHox} genes are often linked in the genome forming two clusters of genes, the Hox cluster and the {ParaHox} cluster, and are expressed along the major body axis in a nested fashion, following the relative positions of the genes within these clusters, a property called colinearity. While the presences of a Hox cluster and a {ParaHox} cluster appear to be primitive for bilaterians, few taxa have actually been examined for spatial and temporal colinearity, and, aside from chordates, even fewer still manifest it. Here we show that the {ParaHox} genes of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus show both spatial and temporal colinearity, but with peculiarities. Specifically, two of the three {ParaHox} genes-discovered through the S. purpuratus genome project-Sp-lox and Sp-Cdx, are expressed in the developing gut with nested domains in a spatially colinear manner. However, transcripts of Sp-Gsx, although anterior of Sp-lox, are detected in the ectoderm and not in the gut. Strikingly, the expression of the three {ParaHox} genes would follow temporal colinearity if they were clustered in the same order as in chordates, but each {ParaHox} gene is actually found on a different genomic scaffold (\&gt; 300 kb each), which suggests that they are not linked into a single coherent cluster. Therefore, {ParaHox} genes are dispersed in the genome and are used during embryogenesis in a temporally and spatially coherent manner, whereas the Hox genes, now fully sequenced and annotated, are still linked and are employed as a complex only during the emergence of the adult body plan in the larva.},

	abstract = {Notochord cells in ascidian embryos are formed by the inducing action of cells of presumptive endoderm, as well as neighboring presumptive notochord, at the 32-cell stage. Studies of the timing of induction using recombinations of isolated blastomeres have suggested that notochord induction must be initiated before the decompaction of blastomeres at the 32-cell stage and is completed by the 64-cell stage. However, it is not yet clear how the duration of notochord induction is strictly limited. In the present paper, the aim was to determine in detail when the presumptive notochord blastomeres lost their competence to respond, and when the presumptive endoderm blastomeres produced inducing signals for the notochord. Presumptive notochord blastomeres and presumptive endoderm blastomeres were isolated from early 32-cell embryos, and were heterochronously recombined at various stages ranging from the early 32-cell stage to the 64-cell stage. Presumptive notochord blastomeres could respond to inductive signals at the early 32-cell stage, and started to lose their responsiveness at the decompaction stage. By contrast, the presumptive endoderm blastomeres persisted in their inducing capacity even at the 64-cell stage. These observations suggest that the loss of competence in presumptive notochord blastomeres limits the duration of notochord induction in intact ascidian embryos.},

	abstract = {Most ascidians pass through a tadpole (urodele) larval stage, although some species have derived a tailless (anural) larva. New insights into the evolution of anural larvae in the Roscovita clade of molgulid ascidians were obtained from studing embryonic development of the transitional anural species Molgula bleizi and from phylogenetic analysis based on muscle and cytoskeletal actin gene sequences. By observing in vitro fertilized eggs, we found that M. bleizi, previously described as a typical anural developer, actually forms a short immotile tail during embryogenesis. The short tail contains notochord lineage cells, which undergo abbreviated morphogenetic movements but eventually arrest in development. Molgula bleizi tail muscle lineage cells produce the muscle enzyme acetylcholinesterase ({AChE}) but do not express muscle actin genes. The presence of a short tail, a vestigial notochord, and {AChE}-positive muscle cells suggest that M. bleizi is a recently derived anural species. An M. bleizi larval muscle actin gene ({MbMA}1) was isolated, sequenced, and shown to be a pseudogene based on critical deletions in its coding region that would result in a nonfunctional actin protein. The mutations in {MbMA}1 are distinct from and have evolved independent of the larval muscle actin pseudogenes {MoccMA}1a and {MoccMA}1b in Molgula occulta, another anural developer in the Roscovita clade. Pseudogene formation explains the absence of muscle actin {mRNA} in M. bleizi embryos. The 3' untranslated region of an M. bleizi cytoskeletal actin gene was also isolated and sequenced. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed using muscle and cytoskeletal actin sequences suggest that the anural developer M. bleizi evolved prior to the divergence of the urodele developer Molgula oculata and the anural developer M. occulta in the Roscovita clade. Since M. bleizi lives attached to hard substrata in the tidal zone, whereas M. oculata and M. occulta live buried in subtidal sand flats, our results suggest that the anural larva evolved at least twice in the Roscovita clade of molgulid ascidians as an adaptation to different habitats.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Next generation sequencing ({NGS}) technology has revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's {PGM}, Pacific Biosciences' {RS} and the Illumina {MiSeq}. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina {HiSeq}, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean {GC} content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7\%. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, {GC} distribution, variant detection and accuracy.
{RESULTS}: Sequence generated by Ion Torrent, {MiSeq} and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour on {GC}-rich, neutral and moderately {AT}-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing the extremely {AT}-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the {PGM}, resulting in no coverage for approximately 30\% of the genome. We analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent data compared to {MiSeq} data, but at the expense of a higher false positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific errors were observed in both {PGM} and {MiSeq} data, but not in that from the Pacific Biosciences platform.
{CONCLUSIONS}: All three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate usable sequence. However there are key differences between the quality of that data and the applications it will support.},

	abstract = {Differences in cell responsiveness to an inductive signal contribute to the emergence of a variety of tissue types during animal development. In ascidian embryos, the Fibroblast Growth Factor ({FGF}) signal secreted from endoderm cells induces several different tissue types, such as notochord, mesenchyme and brain, at different positions in the embryo at the 32-cell stage. We show here in Halocynthia roretzi that {FoxA} and Zic are required for notochord formation in cells that receive the {FGF} signal. We also show that these transcription factors, only when both are supplied, are able to induce ectopic expression of the brachyury gene, a notochord-specific marker, in cells of all the three germ layers in an {FGF}-dependent manner. These results suggest that {FoxA} and Zic confer notochord-specific responsiveness to {FGF} signaling. Further analyses including knockdown and over-expression experiments showed that combinatorial inputs from maternally supplied and zigotically activated factors lead to overlapping expression of {FoxA} and Zic in the presumptive notochord cells, which eventually activate the expression of the brachyury gene in cooperation with {FGF} signaling. Our data illustrate how a complex gene network specifies the notochord at its specific position within the embryo.},

Frogs and fish have known orthologs of some but not all of these proteins, and homologs of the family are also found in protochordates, insects and nematodes. The proteins have a characteristic helix-span-helix motif at the carboxyl terminus, which, together with a central basic region, mediates dimerization and {DNA} binding. The amino terminus contains the transactivation domain. {AP}-2 proteins are first expressed in primitive ectoderm of invertebrates and vertebrates; in vertebrates, they are also expressed in the emerging neural-crest cells, and {AP}-2alpha-/- animals have impairments in neural-crest-derived facial structures. {AP}-2beta is indispensable for kidney development and {AP}-2gamma is necessary for the formation of trophectoderm cells shortly after implantation; {AP}-2alpha and {AP}-2gamma levels are elevated in human mammary carcinoma and seminoma. The general functions of the family appear to be the cell-type-specific stimulation of proliferation and the suppression of terminal differentiation during embryonic development.},

	abstract = {Vertebrate gastrulation entails massive cell movements that establish and shape the germ layers. During gastrulation, the individual cell behaviors are strictly coordinated in time and space by various signaling pathways. These pathways instruct the cells about proliferation, shape, fate and migration into proper location. Convergence and extension (C\&E) movements during vertebrate gastrulation play a major role in the shaping of the embryonic body. In vertebrates, the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/{PCP}) pathway is a key regulator of C\&E movements, essential for several polarized cell behaviors, including directed cell migration, and mediolateral and radial cell intercalation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of planar cell polarity by highly dynamic mesenchymal cells engaged in C\&E is still not well understood. Each cell in the embryo needs spatial and temporal information, which are required for its appropriate behavior, and the Wnt/{PCP} pathway provides this information by a yet unclear mechanism. Here we review new evidence implicating the Wnt/{PCP} pathway in specific cell behaviors required for C\&E during zebrafish gastrulation, in comparison to other vertebrates. We also discuss findings on the molecular regulation and the interaction of the Wnt/{PCP} pathway with other signaling pathways during gastrulation movements.},

	abstract = {Oesophageal atresia ({OA}) and tracheooesophageal fistula ({TOF}) are relatively common human congenital malformations of the foregut where the oesophagus does not connect with the stomach and there is an abnormal connection between the stomach and the respiratory tract. They require immediate corrective surgery and have an impact on the future health of the individual. These abnormalities are mimicked by exposure of rat and mouse embryos in utero to the drug adriamycin. The causes of {OA}/{TOF} during human development are not known, however a number of mouse mutants where different signalling pathways are directly affected, show similar abnormalities, implicating multiple and complex signalling mechanisms. The similarities in developmental outcome seen in human infants and in the adriamycin treated mouse model underline the potential of this model to unravel the early embryological events and further our understanding of the processes disturbed, leading to such abnormalities. Here we report a systematic study of the foregut and adjacent tissues in embryos treated with adriamycin at E7 and E8 and analysed between E9 and E12, comparing morphology in 3D in 149 specimens. We describe a spectrum of 8 defects, the most common of which is ventral displacement and branching of the notochord (in 94\% of embryos at E10) and a close spatial correspondence between the site of notochord branching and defects of the foregut. In addition gene expression analysis shows altered dorso-ventral foregut patterning in the vicinity of notochord branches. This study shows a number of features of the adriamycin mouse model not previously reported, implicates the notochord as a primary site of disturbance in such abnormalities and underlines the importance of the model to further address the mechanistic basis of foregut congenital abnormalities.},

A 50 kb genomic region of chicken Sox2 was isolated and scanned for enhancer activity utilizing embryo electroporation, resulting in identification of a battery of enhancers. Although Sox2 expression in the early embryonic {CNS} appears uniform, it is actually pieced together by five separate enhancers with distinct spatio-temporal specificities, including the one activated by the neural induction signals emanating from Hensen's node. Enhancers for Sox2 expression in the lens and nasal/otic placodes and in the neural crest were also determined. These functionally identified Sox2 enhancers exactly correspond to the extragenic sequence blocks conspicuously conserved between chicken and mammals, which are not discernible by sequence comparison among mammals.},

By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments.

	abstract = {The origin of chordates has been debated for more than a century, with one key issue being the emergence of the notochord. In vertebrates, the notochord develops by convergence and extension of the chordamesoderm, a population of midline cells of unique molecular identity. We identify a population of mesodermal cells in a developing invertebrate, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, that converges and extends toward the midline and expresses a notochord-specific combination of genes. These cells differentiate into a longitudinal muscle, the axochord, that is positioned between central nervous system and axial blood vessel and secretes a strong collagenous extracellular matrix. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that contractile mesodermal midline cells existed in bilaterian ancestors. We propose that these cells, via vacuolization and stiffening, gave rise to the chordate notochord.
Origin of the spine lies in a worm
The notochord, the developmental backbone precursor, defines chordates—the group of animals to which humans belong. The origin of the notochord remains mysterious. Lauri et al. report the identification of a longitudinal muscle in an annelid worm that displays striking similarities to the notochord regarding position, developmental origin, and expression profile. Similar muscles, termed axochords, are found in various invertebrate phyla. These data suggest that the last common ancestor of bilaterians already possessed contractile midline tissue that, via stiffening, developed into a cartilaginous rod in the chordate line.

	abstract = {Ascidians are members of the vertebrate sister group Urochordata. Their larvae exhibit a chordate body plan, which forms by a highly accelerated embryonic strategy involving a fixed cell lineage and small cell numbers. We report a detailed analysis of the specification of three of the five pairs of motoneurons in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and show that despite well-conserved gene expression patterns and embryological outcomes compared with vertebrates, key signalling molecules have adopted different roles. We employed a combination of cell ablation and gene manipulation to analyse the function of two signalling molecules with key roles in vertebrate motoneuron specification that are known to be expressed equivalently in ascidians: the inducer Sonic hedgehog, produced ventrally by the notochord and floorplate; and the inhibitory {BMP}2/4, produced on the lateral/dorsal side of the neural plate. Our surprising conclusion is that neither {BMP}2/4 signalling nor the ventral cell lineages expressing hedgehog play crucial roles in motoneuron formation in Ciona. Furthermore, {BMP}2/4 overexpression induced ectopic motoneurons, the opposite of its vertebrate role. We suggest that the specification of motoneurons has been modified during ascidian evolution, such that {BMP}2/4 has adopted a redundant inductive role rather than a repressive role and Nodal, expressed upstream of {BMP}2/4 in the dorsal neural tube precursors, acts as a motoneuron inducer during normal development. Thus, our results uncover significant differences in the mechanisms used for motoneuron specification within chordates and also highlight the dangers of interpreting equivalent expression patterns as indicative of conserved function in evo-devo studies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The regulatory map of a genome consists of the binding sites for proteins that determine the transcription of nearby genes. An initial regulatory map for S. cerevisiae was recently published using six motif discovery programs to analyze genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data for 203 transcription factors. The programs were used to identify sequence motifs that were likely to correspond to the {DNA}-binding specificity of the immunoprecipitated proteins. We report improved versions of two conservation-based motif discovery algorithms, {PhyloCon} and Converge. Using these programs, we create a refined regulatory map for S. cerevisiae by reanalyzing the same chromatin immunoprecipitation data. {RESULTS}: Applying the same conservative criteria that were applied in the original study, we find that {PhyloCon} and Converge each separately discover more known specificities than the combination of all six programs in the previous study. Combining the results of {PhyloCon} and Converge, we discover significant sequence motifs for 36 transcription factors that were previously missed. The new set of motifs identifies 636 more regulatory interactions than the previous one. The new network contains 28\% more regulatory interactions among transcription factors, evidence of greater cross-talk between regulators. {CONCLUSION}: Combining two complementary computational strategies for conservation-based motif discovery improves the ability to identify the specificity of transcriptional regulators from genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data. The increased sensitivity of these methods significantly expands the map of yeast regulatory sites without the need to alter any of the thresholds for statistical significance. The new map of regulatory sites reveals a more elaborate and complex view of the yeast genetic regulatory network than was observed previously.},

	abstract = {The expression of the transcription factor gene Sox2 precisely marks the neural plate in various vertebrate species. We previously showed that the Sox2 expression prevailing in the neural plate of chicken embryos is actually regulated by the coordination of five phylogenetically conserved enhancers having discrete regional coverage, among which the 420-bp long enhancer N-1, active in the node-proximal region, is probably involved directly in the genesis of the posterior neural plate. We investigated the signaling systems regulating this enhancer, first identifying the 56-bp N-1 core enhancer (N-1c), which in a trimeric form recapitulates the activity of the enhancer N-1. Mutational analysis identified five blocks, A to E, that regulate the enhancer N-1c. Functional analysis of these blocks indicated that Wnt and {FGF} signals synergistically activate the enhancer through Blocks A-B, bound by Lef1, and Block D, respectively. Fgf8b and Wnt8c expressed in the organizer-primitive streak region account for the activity in the embryo. Block E is essential for the repression of the enhancer N-1c activity in the mesendodermal precursors. The enhancer N-1c is not affected by {BMP} signals. Thus, Wnt and {FGF} signals converge to activate Sox2 expression through the enhancer N-1c, revealing the direct involvement of the Wnt signal in the initiation of neural plate development.},

The first studies to put the next generation sequencing ({NGS}) to the test in ecologically well-characterized species without previous genome information were published in 2007 and the beginning of 2008. Since then several studies have followed in their footsteps, and a large number are undoubtedly under way.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Several new de novo assembly tools have been developed recently to assemble short sequencing reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms. However, the performance of these tools under various conditions has not been fully investigated, and sufficient information is not currently available for informed decisions to be made regarding the tool that would be most likely to produce the best performance under a specific set of conditions. {RESULTS}: We studied and compared the performance of commonly used de novo assembly tools specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data, including {SSAKE}, {VCAKE}, Euler-sr, Edena, Velvet, {ABySS} and {SOAPdenovo}. Tools were compared using several performance criteria, including N50 length, sequence coverage and assembly accuracy. Various properties of read data, including single-end/paired-end, sequence {GC} content, depth of coverage and base calling error rates, were investigated for their effects on the performance of different assembly tools. We also compared the computation time and memory usage of these seven tools. Based on the results of our comparison, the relative performance of individual tools are summarized and tentative guidelines for optimal selection of different assembly tools, under different conditions, are provided.},

	abstract = {In the ascidian embryo, the nerve cord and notochord of the tail of tadpole larvae originate from the precursor blastomeres for both tissues in the 32-cell-stage embryo. Each fate is separated into two daughter blastomeres at the next cleavage. We have examined mechanisms that are responsible for nerve cord and notochord specification through experiments involving blastomere isolation, cell dissociation, and treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor ({bFGF}) and inhibitors for the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) cascade. It has been shown that inductive cell interaction at the 32-cell stage is required for notochord formation. Our results show that the nerve cord fate is determined autonomously without any cell interaction. Presumptive notochord blastomeres also assume a nerve cord fate when they are isolated before induction is completed. By contrast, not only presumptive notochord blastomeres but also presumptive nerve cord blastomeres forsake their default nerve cord fate and choose the notochord fate when they are treated with {bFGF}. When the {FGF}-Ras-{MAPK} signaling cascade is inhibited, both blastomeres choose the default nerve cord pathway, supporting the results of blastomere isolation. Thus, binary choice of alternative fates and asymmetric division are involved in this nerve cord/notochord fate determination system, mediated by {FGF} signaling.},

A screen for N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ({ENU})-induced mutations affecting early development in the ascidian Ciona savignyi resulted in the isolation of a number of mutants including the complementing notochord mutants chongmague and chobi. In chongmague embryos the notochord fails to develop, and the notochord cells instead adopt a mesenchyme-like fate. The failure of notochord development in chongmague embryos results in a severe truncation of tail, although development of the tail muscles and caudal nerve tracts appears largely normal. Chobi embryos also have a truncation of the tail stemming from a disruption of the notochord. However, in chobi embryos the early development of the notochord appears normal and defects occur later as the notochord attempts to extend and direct elongation of the tail. We find in chobi tailbud embryos that the notochord is often bent, with cells clumped together, rather than extended as a column. These results provide new information on the function and development of the ascidian notochord. In addition, the results demonstrate how the unique features of ascidians can be used in genetic analysis of morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {During development, epithelial cells in some tissues acquire a polarity orthogonal to their apical-basal axis. This polarity, referred to as planar cell polarity ({PCP}), or tissue polarity, is essential for the normal physiological function of many epithelia. Early studies of {PCP} focused on insect epithelia (Lawrence, 1966 [1]), and the earliest genetic analyses were carried out in Drosophila (Held et al., 1986; Gubb and Garcia-Bellido, 1982 [2,3]). Indeed, most of our mechanistic understanding of {PCP} derives from the ongoing use of Drosophila as a model system. However, a range of medically important developmental defects and physiological processes are under the control of {PCP} mechanisms that appear to be at least partially conserved, driving considerable interest in studying {PCP} both in Drosophila and in vertebrate model systems. Here, I present a model of the {PCP} signaling mechanism based on studies in Drosophila. I highlight two areas in which our understanding is deficient, and which lead to current confusion in the literature. Future studies that shed light on these areas will substantially enhance our understanding of the fascinating yet challenging problem of understanding the mechanisms that generate {PCP}.},

Documenting patterns of genetic adaptation to these variables in locations that currently experience geographic variation in them is an important tool in understanding the potential for natural selection to allow populations to adapt as climate change proceeds. We sequenced the mantle transcriptome of 39 red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) individuals from three regions (Monterey Bay, Sonoma, north of Cape Mendocino) distinct in temperature, aragonite saturation, exposure to hypoxia and disease pressure along the California coast. Among 1.17 × 106 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ({SNPs}) identified in this study (1.37\% of the transcriptome), 21 579 could be genotyped for all individuals. A principal components analysis concluded that the vast majority of {SNPs} show no population structure from Monterey, California to the Oregon border, in corroboration with several previous studies. In contrast, an {FST} outlier analysis indicated 691 {SNPs} as exhibiting significantly higher than expected differentiation (experiment-wide P {\textless} 0.05). From these, it was possible to identify 163 genes through {BLAST} annotation, 34 of which contained more than one outlier {SNP}. A large number of these genes are involved in biomineralization, energy metabolism, heat-, disease- or hypoxia-tolerance. These genes are candidate loci for spatial adaptation to geographic variation that is likely to increase in the future.},

In this study, we surveyed the multipotent myogenic B7.5 lineage in Molgula spp. Comparisons to the homologous lineage in Ciona revealed identical cell division and fate specification events that result in segregation of larval, cardiac, and pharyngeal muscle progenitors. Moreover, the expression patterns of key regulators are conserved, but cross-species transgenic assays uncovered incompatibility, or 'unintelligibility', of orthologous cis-regulatory sequences between Molgula and Ciona. These sequences drive identical expression patterns that are not recapitulated in cross-species assays. We show that this unintelligibility is likely due to changes in both cis- and trans-acting elements, hinting at widespread and frequent turnover of regulatory mechanisms underlying otherwise conserved aspects of ascidian embryogenesis.},

Using microarrays, we analyzed genes that were expressed in 11 organs of the adult, including the neural complex, branchial sac, esophagus, stomach, endostyle, intestine, body-wall muscle, heart, blood cells, ovary and testis. This analysis identified 158 genes that are expressed ubiquitously in these organs. These housekeeping genes could be classified into a range of Gene Ontology categories, in particular, ribosomal protein components. Of these 158 genes, we were able to map 141 genes onto the 14 pairs of the C. intestinalis chromosomes. They were distributed rather evenly over all the chromosomes, except for small clusters containing two or three genes. Therefore, the notion of chromosomal clustering of housekeeping genes is not applicable in this chordate.},

We show that Wnt1-Cre inactivation of up to three Msx1/2 alleles results in a progressively larger defect in the neural crest-derived frontal bone. Unexpectedly, in embryos lacking all four Msx1/2 alleles, the large defect is filled in with mispatterned bone consisting of ectopic islands of bone between the reduced frontal bones, just anterior to the parietal bones. The bone is derived from neural crest, not mesoderm, and, from {DiI} cell marking experiments, originates in a normally non-osteogenic layer of cells through which the rudiment elongates apically. Associated with the heterotopic osteogenesis is an upregulation of Bmp signaling in this cell layer. Prevention of this upregulation by implantation of noggin-soaked beads in head explants also prevented heterotopic bone formation. These results suggest that Msx genes have a dual role in calvarial development: They are required for the differentiation and proliferation of osteogenic cells within rudiments, and they are also required to suppress an osteogenic program in a cell layer within which the rudiments grow. We suggest that the inactivation of this repressive activity may be one cause of Wormian bones, ectopic bones that are a feature of a variety of pathological conditions in which calvarial bone development is compromised.},

	abstract = {Differences in gene expression are an important source of phenotypic variation, and can be caused by changes in cis and/or trans regulation. cis-regulatory variants alter allele-specific expression, whereas trans-regulatory variants influence expression of both alleles in a diploid cell. Because of this difference, we hypothesize that natural selection may favor one type of change over the other. Here, we investigate contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to variable intra- and interspecific gene expression using four strains of Drosophila melanogaster, three strains of D. simulans and a total of 78 genes. We show that cis-regulatory changes account for a greater proportion of the expression differences observed between rather than within species. These data are inconsistent with a neutral model assuming equal probabilities of fixation for cis- and trans-regulatory polymorphisms, suggesting that natural selection influences the molecular mechanisms underlying divergent gene expression. Specifically, cis-regulatory changes seem to accumulate preferentially over time.},

	doi = {10.1242/dev.046938},
	abstract = {In animals, region specific morphological characters along the anteroposterior axis are controlled by a number of developmental genes, including Hox genes encoding homeodomain transcription factors. Although Hox genes have been regarded to play a key role in the evolution of morphological diversity, as well as in the establishment of the body plan, little is known about the function of Hox genes in invertebrates, except for in insects and nematodes. The present study addresses the role of Hox genes in body patterning during the larval development of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis conducting knockdown experiments of the seven Hox genes expressed during embryogenesis. Experimental results have demonstrated that Ci-Hox12 plays an important role in tail development through the maintenance of expression of Ci-Fgf8/17/18 and Ci-Wnt5 in the tail tip epidermis. Additionally, it has been shown that Ci-Hox10 is involved in the development of {GABAergic} neurons in the dorsal visceral ganglion. Surprisingly, knockdown of Ci-Hox1, Ci-Hox2, Ci-Hox3, Ci-Hox4 and Ci-Hox5 did not give rise to any consistent morphological defects in the larvae. Furthermore, expression of neuronal marker genes was not affected in larvae injected with {MOs} against Ci-Hox1, Ci-Hox3 or Ci-Hox5. In conclusion, we suggest that the contribution of Hox genes to the larval development of the ascidian C. intestinalis might be limited, despite the fact that Ci-Hox10 and Ci-Hox12 play important roles in neuronal and tail development.},

However, genome assembly remains extremely challenging for highly polymorphic species. The difficulty arises because two divergent haplotypes are sequenced together, making it difficult to distinguish alleles at the same locus from paralogs at different loci. We present here a method for assembling highly polymorphic diploid genomes that involves assembling the two haplotypes separately and then merging them to obtain a reference sequence. Our method was developed to assemble the genome of the sea squirt Ciona savignyi, which was sequenced to a depth of 12.7 x from a single wild individual. By comparing finished clones of the two haplotypes we determined that the sequenced individual had an extremely high heterozygosity rate, averaging 4.6\% with significant regional variation and rearrangements at all physical scales. Applied to these data, our method produced a reference assembly covering 157 Mb, with N50 contig and scaffold sizes of 47 kb and 989 kb, respectively. Alignment of {ESTs} indicates that 88\% of loci are present at least once and 81\% exactly once in the reference assembly. Our method represented loci in a single copy more reliably and achieved greater contiguity than a conventional whole-genome assembly method.},

	abstract = {Despite its importance in development and physiology the planar cell polarity ({PCP}) pathway remains one of the most enigmatic signaling mechanisms. The notochord of the ascidian Ciona provides a unique model for investigating the {PCP} pathway. Interestingly, the notochord appears to be the only embryonic structure in Ciona activating the {PCP} pathway. Moreover, the Ciona notochord as a single-file array of forty polarized cells is a uniquely tractable system for the study of polarization dynamics and the transmission of the {PCP} pathway. Here, we test models for propagation of a polarizing signal, interrogating temporal, spatial and signaling requirements. A simple cell-cell relay cascading through the entire length of the notochord is not supported; instead a more complex mechanism is revealed, with interactions influencing polarity between neighboring cells, but not distant ones. Mechanisms coordinating notochord-wide polarity remain elusive, but appear to entrain general (i.e., global) polarity even while local interactions remain important. However, this global polarizer does not appear to act as a localized, spatially-restricted determinant. Coordination of polarity along the long axis of the notochord requires the {PCP} pathway, a role we demonstrate is temporally distinct from this pathway's earlier role in convergent extension and intercalation. We also reveal polarity in the notochord to be dynamic: a cell's polarity state can be changed and then restored, underscoring the Ciona notochord's amenability for in vivo studies of {PCP}.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. {edgeR} is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing ({RNA}-seq) has been readily embraced by geneticists and molecular ecologists alike. As with all high-throughput technologies, it is critical to understand which analytic strategies are best suited and which parameters may bias the interpretation of the data. Here we use a comprehensive simulation approach to explore how various features of the transcriptome (complexity, degree of polymorphism π, alternative splicing), technological processing (sequencing error ϵ, library normalization) and bioinformatic workflow (de novo vs. mapping assembly, reference genome quality) impact transcriptome quality and inference of differential gene expression ({DE}). We find that transcriptome assembly and gene expression profiling ({EdgeR} vs. {BaySeq} software) works well even in the absence of a reference genome and is robust across a broad range of parameters. We advise against library normalization and in most situations advocate mapping assemblies to an annotated genome of a divergent sister clade, which generally outperformed de novo assembly (Trans-Abyss, Trinity, Soapdenovo-Trans). Transcriptome complexity (size, paralogs, alternative splicing isoforms) negatively affected the assembly and {DE} profiling, whereas the effects of sequencing error and polymorphism were almost negligible. Finally, we highlight the challenge of gene name assignment for de novo assemblies, the importance of mapping strategies and raise awareness of challenges associated with the quality of reference genomes. Overall, our results have significant practical and methodological implications and can provide guidance in the design and analysis of {RNA}-seq experiments, particularly for organisms where genomic background information is lacking.},

The initial rudiment is formed in part as a consequence of the pattern of mitotic divisions as the blastophore shifts posteriorly. Vertical and horizontal rearrangements produce an elongate rod of disc-shaped cells stacked end to end. Further elongation is accompanied by a cell shape change. Some cell growth or swelling is indicated to occur later in development, but this growth appears to contribute mostly to an increase in the diameter, and only insignificantly to the length of the notochord. Intracellular vacuoles that appear around 13 h after fertilization increase in size and fuse at about 16 h to form intercellular ones. These in turn merge to form the central matrix core of the notochord at around 18 to 20 h. As the notochord elongates and cells change in shape, the basal surfaces bleb actively. This surface activity may be related to formation of the perinotochordal sheath.},

	volume = {122},
	issn = {0950-1991},
	abstract = {The tadpole larva of an ascidian develops 40 notochord cells in the center of its tail. Most of the notochord cells originate from the A-line precursors, among which inductive interactions are required for the subsequent differentiation of notochord. The presumptive-endoderm blastomeres or presumptive-notochord blastomeres themselves are inducers of notochord formation. Notochord induction takes place during the 32-cell stage. In amphibia, mesoderm induction is thought to be mediated by several growth factors, for example, activins and basic fibroblast growth factor ({bFGF}). In the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, treatment with {bFGF} of presumptive-notochord blastomeres that had been isolated at the early 32-cell stage promoted the formation of notochord at a low concentration of {bFGF} (0.02 ng/ml), while activin failed to induce notochord differentiation. The effect of {bFGF} reached a maximum at the end of the 32-cell stage and rapidly faded at the beginning of the subsequent cleavage, the time for full induction of notochord being at least 20 minutes. The expression of As-T, a previously isolated ascidian homolog of the mouse Brachyury (T) gene, starts at the 64-cell stage and is detectable exclusively in the presumptive-notochord blastomeres. The present study showed that presumptive-notochord blastomeres, isolated at the early 32-cell stage, neither differentiated into notochord nor expressed the As-T gene. However, when the presumptive-notochord blastomeres were coisolated or recombined with inducer blastomeres, transcripts of As-T were detected. When presumptive-notochord blastomeres were treated with {bFGF}, the expression of the As-T gene was also detected. These results suggest that inductive interaction is required for the expression of the As-T gene and that the expression of the As-T gene is closely correlated with the determined state of the notochord-precursor cells.},

Recent draft genome analysis of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis has identified 9 Hox genes, which, however, have been located on five scaffolds. Similarly, expression patterns of Ciona Hox genes are largely unknown, although some data have been available for a few Hox member genes. Thus, the cluster structure and colinearity of Hox genes are still an enigma in C. intestinalis. To address these issues, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole-mount in situ hybridization techniques and examined the genomic organization and spatiotemporal expression of all Hox as well as extended Hox member genes (Evx and Mox) of C. intestinalis. We found that seven of nine Ciona Hox genes are located on a single chromosome with some ordering exceptions, and the other genes, including Evx and Mox, are located on three other chromosomes. Some Ciona Hox genes, if not all, exhibited spatially coordinated expression within the larval central nervous system and the gut of the juvenile. In light of these observations, we suggest that the cluster organization and colinearity of the Hox genes are under dispersing and disintegrating conditions in C. intestinalis.},

The notochord, which is composed of a stack of flat cells surrounded by a connective tissue sheath, elongates dramatically and begins straightening between stages 21 and 25. At this time the fiber density in the notochord sheath goes up, the osmotic activity of the notochord cells increases, vacuoles within these cells swell, the internal pressure of the notochord increases 2- to 3-fold, and the flexural stiffness of the notochord rises by an order of magnitude. We suggest that the tendency of the notochord cells to osmotically swell is resisted by the sheath, thereby permitting the internal pressure to rise. This pressure increase results in the greater stiffness that permits the notochord to elongate and straighten without being buckled by the surrounding tissues.},

	abstract = {Cell elongation is a fundamental process that allows cells and tissues to adopt new shapes and functions. During notochord tubulogenesis in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a dramatic elongation of individual cells takes place that lengthens the notochord and, consequently, the entire embryo. We find a novel dynamic actin- and non-muscle myosin {II}-containing constriction midway along the anteroposterior aspect of each notochord cell during this process. Both actin polymerization and myosin {II} activity are required for the constriction and cell elongation. Discontinuous localization of myosin {II} in the constriction indicates that the actomyosin network produces local contractions along the circumference. This reveals basal constriction by the actomyosin network as a novel mechanism for cell elongation. Following elongation, the notochord cells undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition and form two apical domains at opposite ends. Extracellular lumens then form at the apical surfaces. We show that cortical actin and Ciona ezrin/radixin/moesin ({ERM}) are essential for lumen formation and that a polarized network of microtubules, which contributes to lumen development, forms in an actin-dependent manner at the apical cortex. Later in notochord tubulogenesis, when notochord cells initiate a bi-directional crawling movement on the notochordal sheath, the microtubule network rotates 90° and becomes organized as parallel bundles extending towards the leading edges of tractive lamellipodia. This process is required for the correct organization of actin-based protrusions and subsequent lumen coalescence. In summary, we establish the contribution of the actomyosin and microtubule networks to notochord tubulogenesis and reveal extensive crosstalk and regulation between these two cytoskeleton components.},

In the present study, we examined the effects of functional suppression of nine Bra-downstream notochord genes, which include Ci-{PTP}, Ci-{ACL}, Ci-prickle, Ci-netrin, Ci-trop, Ci-Noto3, Ci-{ASAK}, Ci-{ERM} and Ci-pellino. When the function of the first two genes (Ci-{PTP} and Ci-{ACL}) was suppressed with specific morpholinos, the notochord cells failed to converge, while functional suppression of Ci-prickle resulted in a failure of intercalation, and therefore the cells in these three types of embryo remained in the mid-dorsal region of the embryo. Functional suppression of the next four genes (Ci-netrin, Ci-trop, Ci-Noto3 and Ci-{ASAK}) resulted in the partial defect of intercalation, and the notochord did not consist of a single row. In addition, when the function of the last two genes (Ci-{ERM} and Ci-pellino) was suppressed, notochord cells failed to elongate in the embryo, even though convergence/extension took place normally. These results indicate that many Bra-downstream notochord genes are involved in convergence/extension of the embryo.},

These elements direct expression of a reporter gene to pre-migratory neural crest in transgenic mice, and transgenic expression of a Pax3 {cDNA} using these elements is sufficient to rescue neural crest development in mice otherwise lacking endogenous Pax3. We show here that deletion of these enhancer sequences by homologous recombination is insufficient to abrogate neural crest expression of Pax3 and results in viable mice. We identify a distinct enhancer in the fourth intron that is also capable of mediating neural crest expression in transgenic mice and zebrafish.

	abstract = {Although cell intercalation driven by non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity ({PCP}) pathway-dependent mediolateral cell polarity is important for notochord morphogenesis, it is likely that multiple mechanisms shape the notochord as it converges and extends. Here we show that the recessive short-tailed Ciona savignyi mutation chongmague (chm) has a novel defect in the formation of a morphological boundary around the developing notochord. chm notochord cells initiate intercalation normally, but then fail to maintain their polarized cell morphology and migrate inappropriately to become dispersed in the larval tail. This is unlike aimless (aim), a mutation in the {PCP} pathway component Prickle, which has a severe defect in early mediolateral intercalation but forms a robust notochord boundary. Positional cloning identifies chm as a mutation in the C. savignyi ortholog of the vertebrate alpha 3/4/5 family of laminins. Cs-lamalpha3/4/5 is highly expressed in the developing notochord, and Cs-lamalpha3/4/5 protein is specifically localized to the outer border of the notochord. Notochord convergence and extension, reduced but not absent in both chm and aim, are essentially abolished in the aim/aim; chm/chm double mutant, indicating that laminin-mediated boundary formation and {PCP}-dependent mediolateral intercalation are each able to drive a remarkable degree of tail morphogenesis in the absence of the other. These mechanisms therefore initially act in parallel, but we also find that {PCP} signaling has an important later role in maintaining the perinotochordal/intranotochordal polarity of Cs-lamalpha3/4/5 localization.},

	abstract = {We present evidence that notochord and muscle differentiation are crucial for morphogenesis of the ascidian tail. We developed a novel approach for embryological manipulation of the developing larval tissues using a simple method to introduce {DNA} into Ciona intestinalis and the several available tissue-specific promoters. With such promoters, we misexpressed the Xenopus homeobox gene bix in notochord or muscle of Ciona embryos as a means of interfering with development of these tissues. Ciona embryos expressing bix in the notochord from the 64-cell stage develop into larvae with very short tails, in which the notochord precursors fail to intercalate and differentiate. Larvae with mosaic expression of bix have intermediate phenotypes, in which a partial notochord is formed by the precursor cells that did not receive the transgene while the precursors that express the transgene cluster together and fail to undergo any of the cell-shape changes associated with notochord differentiation. Muscle cells adjacent to differentiated notochord cells are properly patterned, while those next to the notochord precursor cells transformed by bix exhibit various patterning defects. In these embryos, the neural tube extends in the tail to form a nerve cord, while the endodermal strand fails to enter the tail region. Similarly, expression of bix in muscle progenitors impairs differentiation of muscle cells, and as a result, notochord cells fail to undergo normal extension movements. Hence, these larvae have a shorter tail, due to a block in the elongation of the notochord. Taken together, these observations suggest that tail formation in ascidian larvae requires not only signaling from notochord to muscle cells, but also a "retrograde" signal from muscle cells to notochord.},

A prediction is that gene number will differ sharply between invertebrate and vertebrate members of the chordate phylum. A gene number estimation method requiring limited sequence sampling of genomic {DNA} was developed and validated by using data for Caenorhabditis elegans. Using the method, we estimated that the invertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has 15,500 protein-coding genes (+/-3,700). This number is significantly lower than gene numbers of vertebrate chordates, but similar to those of invertebrates in distantly related phyla.

Obtaining a set of well-characterized genes is a basic requirement in the initial steps of any genome annotation process. An accurate set of genes is needed in order to learn about species-specific properties, to train gene-finding programs, and to validate automatic predictions. Unfortunately, many new genome projects lack comprehensive experimental data to derive a reliable initial set of genes.
{RESULTS}: In this study, we report a computational method, {CEGMA} (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach), for building a highly reliable set of gene annotations in the absence of experimental data. We define a set of conserved protein families that occur in a wide range of eukaryotes, and present a mapping procedure that accurately identifies their exon-intron structures in a novel genomic sequence. {CEGMA} includes the use of profile-hidden Markov models to ensure the reliability of the gene structures. Our procedure allows one to build an initial set of reliable gene annotations in potentially any eukaryotic genome, even those in draft stages.

The Brachyury (T) gene in the mouse is essential for formation of mesoderm and, in particular, of notochord. We report here the expression of an ascidian homolog (As-T) of the mouse T gene. A {cDNA} clone for the As-T gene contains a single open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 471 amino acids. Although the overall degree of amino acid identity was not very high (39.9\%, ascidian/mouse), in the N-terminal half the extent of amino acid identity was 78.5\% (ascidian/mouse). The expression of As-T was transient. A single band corresponding to a 2.2 kb {mRNA} was first detected at the 64-cell stage, and a distinct band was found at the gastrula stage, at which time accumulation of the transcripts was maximal. The transcript was barely detectable at the larval stage and was undetectable in adult tissues. The occurrence of As-T transcripts was restricted to notochord-lineage cells, and no other cell types expressed the As-T gene. In addition, the timing of As-T expression coincided with the time of restriction of developmental fate exclusively to notochord in the notochord-lineage cells. It is likely that the Brachyury gene was present when the ancestors of chordates with a notochord emerged and that the primary function of this gene is to specify notochord cells.},

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {The intervertebral disc is a soft tissue, positioned between each of the vertebrae, that accommodates applied biomechanical forces to the spine. The central compartment of the disc contains the nucleus pulposus ({NP}), which is enclosed by the annulus fibrosus and the endplate cartilage. The {NP} is derived from the notochord, a rodlike structure of mesodermal origin. Development of the notochord is tightly regulated by interactive transcription factors and target genes. Since a number of these molecules are unique, they have been used for cell lineage and fate mapping studies of tissues of the intervertebral disc. These studies have shown that in a number of species including human, {NP} tissue retains notochordal cells throughout life. In the adult {NP}, there are present both large and small notochordal cells, as well as a progenitor cell population which can differentiate along the mesengenic pathway. Since tissue renewal in the intervertebral disc is dependent on the ability of these cells to commit to the {NP} lineage and undergo terminal differentiation, studies have been performed to assess which signaling pathways may regulate these activities. The notch signaling pathway is active in the intervertebral disc and is responsive to hypoxia, probably through {HIF}-1α. From a disease viewpoint, it is hypothesized that an oxemic shift, possibly mediated by alterations in the vascular supply to the tissues of the disc, would be expected to lead to a failure in notochordal progenitor cell activation and a decrease in the number of differentiated cells. In turn, this would lead to decrements in function and enhancement of the effect of agents that are known to promote disc degeneration.},

	abstract = {Eight Strongylocentrotus purpuratus cis-regulatory modules, in each of which up to three different transcription factor target sites had been previously authenticated in gene transfer and mutagenesis studies, were compared to the orthologous modules in the genome of Lytechinus variegatus. These species diverged about 50 million years ago. The orthologous modules were identified in sequenced Lytechinus {BACs}, as conserved sequence patches in similar regions of the respective genes. The similar functionality of several of these control modules in the two species was confirmed by cross-species gene transfer experiments. In each case the repertoire of transcription factor target sites was the same in the orthologous modules, but the positions of the individual sites with respect to one another was evolutionarily flexible, even though the intervening sequence was often strongly conserved. The most invariably conserved features, as seen also in other systems, were pairs of target sites that are immediately adjacent to one another. Their conservation is probably due to the necessity for interaction of proximally bound transcription factors, while a facilitated form of sequence conversion might be the mechanism of site position change.},

Limb development is repressed in the abdominal segments of the Drosophila embryo by the hometic genes of the Bithorax complex ({BX}-C). Localized expression of the homeobox gene Distal-less ({DII}) is required for leg development in thoracic segments. We have identified a minimal cis-regulatory enhancer element that directs {DII} expression in the larval leg primordia. We present evidence that the {BX}-C proteins repress {DII} expression in abdominal segments by binding to a small number of specific sites in this element. Mutating these sites eliminates {BX}-C protein binding and renders the element insensitive to {BX}-C-mediated repression in vivo. Repression of limb development in the abdomen appears to be controlled at the {DII} enhancer. Thus {DII} may serve as a downstream target gene through which the homeotic genes control abdominal segment identity in the Drosophila embryo.},

It is achieved by the intersection of two orthogonal axes of polarity: the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis. It is widely thought that bilateral symmetry evolved in the common ancestor of the Bilateria. However, it has long been known that members of the phylum Cnidaria, an outgroup to the Bilateria, also exhibit bilateral symmetry. Recent studies have examined the developmental expression of axial patterning genes in members of the phylum Cnidaria. Hox genes play a conserved role in patterning the A-P axis of bilaterians. Hox genes are expressed in staggered axial domains along the oral-aboral axis of cnidarians, suggesting that Hox patterning of the primary body axis was already present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. Dpp plays a conserved role patterning the D-V axis of bilaterians. Asymmetric expression of dpp about the directive axis of cnidarians implies that this patterning system is similarly ancient. Taken together, these result imply that bilateral symmetry had already evolved before the Cnidaria diverged from the Bilateria.},

	abstract = {Hoxa2 is expressed in cranial neural crest cells that migrate into the second branchial arch and is essential for proper patterning of neural-crest-derived structures in this region. We have used transgenic analysis to begin to address the regulatory mechanisms which underlie neural-crest-specific expression of Hoxa2. By performing a deletion analysis on an enhancer from the Hoxa2 gene that is capable of mediating expression in neural crest cells in a manner similar to the endogenous gene, we demonstrated that multiple cis-acting elements are required for neural-crest-specific activity. One of these elements consists of a sequence that binds to the three transcription factor {AP}-2 family members. Mutation or deletion of this site in the Hoxa2 enhancer abrogates reporter expression in cranial neural crest cells but not in the hindbrain. In both cell culture co-transfection assays and transgenic embryos {AP}-2 family members are able to trans-activate reporter expression, showing that this enhancer functions as an {AP}-2-responsive element in vivo. Reporter expression is not abolished in an {AP}-2(alpha) null mutant embryos, suggesting redundancy with other {AP}-2 family members for activation of the Hoxa2 enhancer. Other cis-elements identified in this study critical for neural-crest-specific expression include an element that influences levels of expression and a conserved sequence, which when multimerized directs expression in a broad subset of neural crest cells. These elements work together to co-ordinate and restrict neural crest expression to the second branchial arch and more posterior regions. Our findings have identified the cis-components that allow Hoxa2 to be regulated independently in rhombomeres and cranial neural crest cells.},

Various numbers of {RNA} short reads were selected from the External {RNA} Control Consortium ({ERCC}) data and human chromosome 22. A number of statistics were then calculated for the resulting contigs from each assembler. Each experiment was repeated multiple times to obtain the mean statistics and standard error estimate. Trinity had relative good performance for both {ERCC} and human data, but it may not consistently generate full length transcripts. {ABySS} was the fastest method but its assembly quality was low. Mira gave a good rate for mapping its contigs onto human chromosome 22, but its computational speed is not satisfactory. Our results suggest that transcript assembly remains a challenge problem for bioinformatics society. Therefore, a novel assembler is in need for assembling transcriptome data generated by next generation sequencing technique.},

During later mouse embryogenesis, the notochord gives rise to the middle part of the intervertebral disc, called the nucleus pulposus. Currently, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for forming the intervertebral discs. Here we demonstrate that hedgehog signaling is required for formation of the intervertebral discs. Removal of hedgehog signaling in the notochord and nearby floorplate resulted in the formation of an aberrant notochord sheath that normally surrounds this structure. In the absence of the notochord sheath, small nuclei pulposi were formed, with most notochord cells dispersed throughout the vertebral bodies during embryogenesis. Our data suggest that the formation of the notochord sheath requires hedgehog signaling and that the sheath is essential for maintaining the rod-like structure of the notochord during early embryonic development. As notochord cells form nuclei pulposi, we propose that the notochord sheath functions as a "wrapper" around the notochord to constrain these cells along the vertebral column.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The draft genome sequence of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, along with associated gene models, has been a valuable research resource. However, recently accumulated expressed sequence tag ({EST})/{cDNA} data have revealed numerous inconsistencies with the gene models due in part to intrinsic limitations in gene prediction programs and in part to the fragmented nature of the assembly.
{RESULTS}: We have prepared a less-fragmented assembly on the basis of scaffold-joining guided by paired-end {EST} and bacterial artificial chromosome ({BAC}) sequences, and {BAC} chromosomal in situ hybridization data. The new assembly (115.2 Mb) is similar in length to the initial assembly (116.7 Mb) but contains 1,272 (approximately 50\%) fewer scaffolds. The largest scaffold in the new assembly incorporates 95 initial-assembly scaffolds. In conjunction with the new assembly, we have prepared a greatly improved global gene model set strictly correlated with the extensive currently available {EST} data. The total gene number (15,254) is similar to that of the initial set (15,582), but the new set includes 3,330 models at genomic sites where none were present in the initial set, and 1,779 models that represent fusions of multiple previously incomplete models. In approximately half, 5'-ends were precisely mapped using 5'-full-length {ESTs}, an important refinement even in otherwise unchanged models.
{CONCLUSION}: Using these new resources, we identify a population of non-canonical (non-{GT}-{AG}) introns and also find that approximately 20\% of Ciona genes reside in operons and that operons contain a high proportion of single-exon genes. Thus, the present dataset provides an opportunity to analyze the Ciona genome much more precisely than ever.},

By combining data generated from 454 Life Sciences (Roche) and Illumina (formerly known as Solexa sequencing) sequencing platforms, we reliably assembled genomes into large scaffolds at a fraction of the traditional cost and without use of a reference sequence. We applied this method to two isolates of the phytopathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae. Sequencing and reassembly of the well-studied tomato and Arabidopsis pathogen, Pto({DC}3000), facilitated development and testing of our method. Sequencing of a distantly related rice pathogen, Por(1\_)(6), demonstrated our method's efficacy for de novo assembly of novel genomes. Our assembly of Por(1\_6) yielded an N50 scaffold size of 531,821 bp with {\textgreater}75\% of the predicted genome covered by scaffolds over 100,000 bp. One of the critical phenotypic differences between strains of P. syringae is the range of plant hosts they infect. This is largely determined by their complement of type {III} effector proteins. The genome of Por(1\_6) is the first sequenced for a P. syringae isolate that is a pathogen of monocots, and, as might be predicted, its complement of type {III} effectors differs substantially from the previously sequenced isolates of this species. The genome of Por(1\_6) helps to define an expansion of the P. syringae pan-genome, a corresponding contraction of the core genome, and a further diversification of the type {III} effector complement for this important plant pathogen species.},

	abstract = {Cell lineages during development of ascidian embryos were analyzed by injection of horseradish peroxidase as a tracer enzyme into identified cells at the one-, two-, four-, and eight-cell stages of the ascidians, Halocynthia roretzi, Ciona intestinalis, and Ascidia ahodori. Identical results were obtained with eggs of the three different species examined. The first cleavage furrow coincided with the bilateral symmetry plane of the embryo. The second furrow did not always divide the embryo into anterior and posterior halves as each of the anterior and posterior cell pairs gave rise to different tissues according to their destinies, which became more definitive in the cell pairs at the eight-cell stage. Of the blastomeres constituting the eight-cell stage embryo, the a4.2 pair (the anterior animal blastomeres) differentiated into epidermis, brain, and presumably sense organ and palps. Every descendant cell of the b4.2 pair (the posterior animal blastomeres) has been thought to become epidermis; however, the horseradish peroxidase injection probe revealed that the b4.2 pair gave rise to not only epidermis but also muscle cells at the caudal tip region of the developing tailbud-stage embryos. The A4.1 pair (the anterior vegetal blastomeres) developed into endoderm, notochord, brain stem, spinal cord, and also muscle cells next the caudal tip muscle cells. From the B4.1 pair (the posterior vegetal blastomeres) originated muscle cells of the anterior and middle parts of the tail, mesenchyme, endoderm, endodermal strand, and also notochord at the caudal tip region. These results clearly demonstrate that muscle cells are derived not only from the B4.1 pair, as has hitherto been believed, but also from both the b4.2 and A4.1 pairs.},

Here, we used {ChIP}-Seq with the enhancer-associated protein p300 from mouse embryonic day 11.5 heart tissue to identify over 3,000 candidate heart enhancers genome wide. Compared to enhancers active in other tissues we studied at this time point, most candidate heart enhancers were less deeply conserved in vertebrate evolution. Nevertheless, transgenic mouse assays of 130 candidate regions revealed that most function reproducibly as enhancers active in the heart, irrespective of their degree of evolutionary constraint. These results provide evidence for a large population of poorly conserved heart enhancers and suggest that the evolutionary conservation of embryonic enhancers can vary depending on tissue type.},

To test whether such genes show distinct patterns of molecular evolution within species, we examined sequence variation at the bric à brac (bab) locus of Drosophila melanogaster. This locus is composed of two anciently duplicated paralogs, bab1 and bab2, which are involved in patterning the adult abdomen, legs, and ovaries. We have sequenced the 148 kb genomic region spanning the bab1 and bab2 genes from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster sampled from a single location. Two non-coding regions, one in each paralog, appear to be under selection. The strongest evidence of directional selection is found in a region of bab2 that has no known functional role. The other region is located in the bab1 paralog and is known to contain a cis-regulatory element that controls sex-specific abdominal pigmentation. The coding region of bab1 appears to be under stronger functional constraint than the bab2 coding sequences. Thus, the two paralogs are evolving under different selective regimes in the same natural population, illuminating the different evolutionary trajectories of partially redundant duplicate genes.},

I summarize the major characteristics of each commercially available platform to enable direct comparisons. In terms of cost per megabase (Mb) of sequence, the Illumina and {SOLiD} platforms are clearly superior (≤\$0.10/Mb vs. {\textgreater}\$10/Mb for 454 and some Ion Torrent chips). In terms of cost per nonmultiplexed sample and instrument run time, the Pacific Biosciences and Ion Torrent platforms excel, with the 454 {GS} Junior and Illumina {MiSeq} also notable in this regard. All platforms allow multiplexing of samples, but details of library preparation, experimental design and data analysis can constrain the options. The wide range of characteristics among available platforms provides opportunities both to conduct groundbreaking studies and to waste money on scales that were previously infeasible. Thus, careful thought about the desired characteristics of these systems is warranted before purchasing or using any of them.

	abstract = {Motivation: The analyses of the increasing number of genome sequences requires shortcuts for the detection of orthologs, such as Reciprocal Best Hits ({RBH}), where orthologs are assumed if two genes each in a different genome find each other as the best hit in the other genome. Two {BLAST} options seem to affect alignment scores the most, and thus the choice of a best hit: the filtering of low information sequence segments and the algorithm used to produce the final alignment. Thus, we decided to test whether such options would help better detect orthologs.
Results: Using Escherichia coli K12 as an example, we compared the number and quality of orthologs detected as {RBH}. We tested four different conditions derived from two options: filtering of low-information segments, hard (default) versus soft; and alignment algorithm, default (based on matching words) versus Smith–Waterman. All options resulted in significant differences in the number of orthologs detected, with the highest numbers obtained with the combination of soft filtering with Smith–Waterman alignments. We compared these results with those of Reciprocal Shortest Distances ({RSD}), supposed to be superior to {RBH} because it uses an evolutionary measure of distance, rather than {BLAST} statistics, to rank homologs and thus detect orthologs. {RSD} barely increased the number of orthologs detected over those found with {RBH}. Error estimates, based on analyses of conservation of gene order, found small differences in the quality of orthologs detected using {RBH}. However, {RSD} showed the highest error rates. Thus, {RSD} have no advantages over {RBH}.
Availability: Orthologs detected as Reciprocal Best Hits using soft masking and Smith–Waterman alignments can be downloaded from http://popolvuh.wlu.ca/Orthologs.

Some specific signature sequences, present in the form of signature residues within the homeodomain or conserved peptides outside the homeodomain, constitute phylogenetic evidence for the monophyly of protostomes and their division into ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans.

	abstract = {Anural development in the ascidian Molgula occulta was examined using tissue-specific markers and interspecific hybridization. Unlike most ascidians, which develop into a swimming tadpole larva (urodele development), M. occulta eggs develop into a tailless slug-like larva (anural development) which metamorphoses into an adult. M. occulta embryos show conventional early cleavage patterns, gastrulation, and neurulation, but then diverge from the urodele developmental mode during larval morphogenesis. M. occulta larvae do not contain a pigmented sensory cell in their brain or form a tail with differentiated notochord and muscle cells. As shown by in situ hybridization with cloned probes and analysis of in vitro translation products, M. occulta embryos do not accumulate high levels of alpha actin or myosin heavy chain {mRNA}. In contrast, acetylcholinesterase is expressed in muscle lineage cells, indicating that various muscle cell features are differentially suppressed. M. occulta embryos also lack tyrosinase activity, suggesting that suppression of brain pigment cell differentiation occurs at an early step in development. M. occulta eggs fertilized with sperm from Molgula oculata (a closely related urodele species) develop into hybrid larvae exhibiting some of the missing urodele features. Some hybrid embryos develop tyrosinase activity and differentiate a brain pigment cell and a short row of notochord cells, and form a short tail. These urodele features appeared together or separately in different hybrid embryos suggesting that they develop by independent mechanisms. In contrast, alpha actin and myosin heavy chain {mRNA} accumulation was not enhanced in hybrid embryos. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms control anural development.},

	abstract = {Environmental and genetic aberrations lead to neural tube closure defects ({NTDs}) in 1 in every 1000 births1. Mouse and frog models for these birth defects have suggested that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2, also known as Strabismus) and other components of planar cell polarity ({PCP}) signalling control neurulation by promoting the convergence of neural progenitors to the midline2-8. Here we report a novel role for {PCP} signalling during neurulation in zebrafish. We demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/{PCP} signalling polarizes neural progenitors along the anterior-posterior axis. This polarity is transiently lost during cell division in the neural keel but is re-established as daughter cells reintegrate into the neuroepithelium. Loss of zebrafish Vangl2 (in trilobite mutants) abolishes the polarization of neural keel cells, disrupts re-intercalation of daughter cells into the neuroepithelium, and results in ectopic neural progenitor accumulations and {NTDs}. Remarkably, blocking cell division leads to rescue of trilobite neural tube morphogenesis despite persistent defects in convergence and extension. These results reveal a role for {PCP} signalling in coupling cell division and morphogenesis at neurulation and suggest a novel mechanism underlying {NTDs}.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Sox2 is a core component of the pluripotency control circuits in the early embryo, and later controls many aspects of neural development. Here, we demonstrate that Sox2 expression in the epiblast (mouse blastoderm) and anterior neural plate ({ANP}) is determined by the upstream enhancer N2. The mouse enhancer N2 exhibits strong activity in mouse {ES} cells, epiblast and {ANP}, and is regulated correctly in chicken and zebrafish embryos. Targeted deletion of this enhancer in mouse embryos caused a large reduction of Sox2 expression to 10\% of that of wild-type levels in epiblast and {ANP}. However, this was tolerated by mouse embryo, probably due to functional compensation by Sox3. The activity of enhancer N2 depends on phylogenetically conserved bipartite {POU} factor-binding motifs in a 73-bp core sequence that function synergistically, but this activation does not involve Sox2. The major {POU} factor expressed at the epiblastic stage is Pou5f1 (Oct3/4), while those in the anterior neural plate are Pou3f factors (Oct6, Brn2 etc.). These factors are gradually exchanged during the transition from epiblast to {ANP} stages in mouse embryos and epiblast stem cells ({EpiSC}). Consistently, enhancer N2 activity changes from full Pou5f1 dependence to Pou3f dependence during the development of neural plate cells ({NPC}) from {EpiSC}, as assessed by specific {POU} factor knockdown in these cells. Zebrafish mutant embryos completely devoid of Pou5f1 activity failed to activate enhancer N2 and to express Sox2 in the blastoderm and {ANP}, and these defects were rescued by exogenous supply of pou5f1. Previously, Pou5f1-Sox2 synergism-dependent Sox2 activation through enhancer {SRR}2 in {ES} cells has been highlighted, but this mechanism is limited to {ES} cells and amniotes. In contrast, the enhancer N2-mediated, {POU} factor-dependent activation of Sox2, without involvement of Sox2, is a phylogenetically conserved core mechanism that functions in gene regulatory networks at early embryonic stages.},

Patches of sequence that are several hundred base pairs in length within these modules are often seen to be 80-95\% identical, although the flanking sequence cannot even be aligned. However, it is unlikely that base pairs located between the transcription factor target sites of cis-regulatory modules have sequence-dependent function, and the mechanism that constrains evolutionary change within cis-regulatory modules is incompletely understood. We chose five functionally characterized cis-regulatory modules from the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) genome and obtained orthologous regulatory and flanking sequences from a bacterial artificial chromosome genome library of a congener, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. As expected, single-nucleotide substitutions and small indels occur freely at many positions within the regulatory modules of these two species, as they do outside the regulatory modules. However, large indels ({\textgreater}20 bp) are statistically almost absent within the regulatory modules, although they are common in flanking intergenic or intronic sequence. The result helps to explain the patterns of evolutionary sequence divergence characteristic of cis-regulatory {DNA}.},

A large fraction of these genes encode transcription factors and signaling molecules, show highly dynamic expression patterns during development, and are deeply evolutionarily conserved and deregulated in various human diseases such as cancer. Because of their importance in development, evolution, and disease, a fundamental question in biology is how these developmental control genes are regulated in such an extensive and precise fashion. Using genomics methods, it has become clear that developmental control genes are a distinct group of genes with special regulatory characteristics. However, a systematic analysis of these characteristics has not been presented. Here we review how developmental control genes were discovered, evaluate their genome-wide regulation and gene structure, discuss emerging evidence for their mode of regulation, and estimate their overall abundance in the genome. Understanding the global regulation of developmental control genes may provide a new perspective on development in the era genomics.},

Brachyury is a transcription activator, and its ability to activate transcription is essential for its biological function, but Brachyury target genes have proved difficult to identify. Here we employ a hormone-inducible Brachyury construct and subtractive hybridization to search for such targets. Using this approach we have isolated Bix1, a homeobox gene expressed both in the marginal zone of Xenopus and in the vegetal hemisphere. Expression of Bix1 is induced in an immediate-early fashion by mesoderm-inducing factors such as activin as well as by the products of the T-box genes Xbra and {VegT} (also known as Antipodean, Brat and Xombi). Activation of Bix1 in response to Xbra is direct in the sense that it does not require protein synthesis, and both Xbra and {VegT} activate expression of a reporter gene driven by the Bix 5' regulatory region, which contains an Xbra/{VegT} binding site. Mis-expression of low levels of Bix1 causes formation of ventral mesoderm, while high levels induce endodermal differentiation. These results suggest that Bix1 acts downstream of both {VegT} and Xbra to induce formation of mesoderm and endoderm.},

However, assembling a transcriptome without a known reference remains a challenging task requiring algorithmic improvements. We present two methods for substantially improving transcriptome de novo assembly. The first method relies on the observation that the use of a single k-mer length by current de novo assemblers is suboptimal to assemble transcriptomes where the sequence coverage of transcripts is highly heterogeneous. We present the Multiple-k method in which various k-mer lengths are used for de novo transcriptome assembly. We demonstrate its good performance by assembling de novo a published next-generation transcriptome sequence data set of Aedes aegypti, using the existing genome to check the accuracy of our method. The second method relies on the use of a reference proteome to improve the de novo assembly. We developed the Scaffolding using Translation Mapping ({STM}) method that uses mapping against the closest available reference proteome for scaffolding contigs that map onto the same protein. In a controlled experiment using simulated data, we show that the {STM} method considerably improves the assembly, with few errors. We applied these two methods to assemble the transcriptome of the non-model catfish Loricaria gr. cataphracta. Using the Multiple-k and {STM} methods, the assembly increases in contiguity and in gene identification, showing that our methods clearly improve quality and can be widely used. The new methods were used to assemble successfully the transcripts of the core set of genes regulating tooth development in vertebrates, while classic de novo assembly failed.},

	abstract = {Urothelial cancers of the bladder ({UC}) comprise biologically heterogeneous group of tumors and display complex genetic alterations. Several genetic changes have been analyzed in detail and some of them are associated with the development and progression of {UCs}. Only a few studies, however, are focused on identifying the order in which the aberrations may appear during {UC} tumorigenesis. We have analyzed 123 papillary {UCs} of the bladder by microsatellites for each of the chromosomal regions that have been suggested to be specifically involved in this type of tumor. We used Bayesian network modeling that enables to uncover multivariate probabilistic dependencies between variables. This methodology applied to {LOH} data allowed us to discover patterns of losses in {UCs}. Exploiting the mechanism of probabilistic reasoning in Bayesian networks we suggest primary and secondary events in tumor pathogenesis and reconstruct the possible flow of progression of allelic changes. Losses of chromosome 9p and 9q were found to be the primary events. Losses of 8p and 17p are important events leading to progression of tumor cell clones. The loss of 17p occurs when both abnormalities of chromosome 9 and 8p are already present. There are chromosomal losses related to 8p (1q, 18q, 10q) and some losses like 5q/5p were associated with 17p, leading to the hypothesis of different genetic pathways of {UC} progression. The abnormalities of chromosome regions 13q, 16q, 6q, 14q, 3p are suggested to be late events being accumulated during the progression of cancer. Although some genetic changes were associated only with the 8p pathway, most secondary genetic changes appear in both pathways.

	abstract = {More than 550 million years ago, chordates originated from a common ancestor shared with nonchordate deuterostomes by developing a novel type of larva, the "tadpole larva." The notochord is the supporting organ of the larval tail and the most prominent feature of chordates; indeed, phylum Chordata is named after this organ. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the notochord over the course of chordate evolution with a special emphasis on a member of T-box gene family, Brachyury. Comparison of the decoded genome of a unicellular choanoflagellate with the genomes of sponge and cnidarians suggests that T-box gene family arose at the time of the evolution of multicellular animals. Gastrulation is a morphogenetic movement that is essential for the formation of two- or three-germ-layered embryos. Brachyury is transiently expressed in the blastopore (bp) region, where it confers on cells the ability to undergo invagination. This process is involved in the formation of the archenteron in all metazoans. This is a "primary" function of Brachyury. During the evolution of chordates, Brachyury gained an additional expression domain at the dorsal midline region of the bp. In this new expression domain, Brachyury served its "secondary" function, recruiting another set of target genes to form a dorsal axial organ, notochord. The Wnt/β-catenin, {BMP}/Nodal, and {FGF}-signaling pathways are involved in the transcriptional activation of Brachyury. We discuss the molecular mechanisms of Brachyury secondary function in the context of the dorsal-ventral (D-V) inversion theory and the aboral-dorsalization hypothesis. Although the scope of this review requires some degree of oversimplification of Brachyury function, it is beneficial to facilitate studies on the notochord formation, a central evolutionary developmental biology problem in the history of metazoan evolution, pointed out first by Alexander Kowalevsky.},

	abstract = {The widespread and rapid adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies has afforded researchers the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of genome level processes that underlie evolutionary change, and perhaps more importantly, the links between genotype and phenotype. In particular, researchers interested in functional biology and adaptation have used these technologies to sequence {mRNA} transcriptomes of specific tissues, which in turn are often compared to other tissues, or other individuals with different phenotypes. While these techniques are extremely powerful, careful attention to data quality is required. In particular, because high-throughput sequencing is more error-prone than traditional Sanger sequencing, quality trimming of sequence reads should be an important step in all data processing pipelines. While several software packages for quality trimming exist, no general guidelines for the specifics of trimming have been developed. Here, using empirically derived sequence data, I provide general recommendations regarding the optimal strength of trimming, specifically in {mRNA}-Seq studies. Although very aggressive quality trimming is common, this study suggests that a more gentle trimming, specifically of those nucleotides whose Phred score {\textless}2 or {\textless}5, is optimal for most studies across a wide variety of metrics.},

	issn = {1097-0177},
	doi = {10.1002/dvdy.24213},
	abstract = {Background: Chondroitin sulfate ({CS}) is a sulfated polysaccharide chain that binds to various core proteins to form proteoglycans. The amount and position of sulfate groups in {CS} are variable among different tissues, and are determined by specific sulfotransferases. Although the ascidians are the closest relatives of vertebrates, the functions of their sulfotransferases have not been studied. Results: The genome of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis contains eight genes encoding proteins similar to chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferases (C6STs), which appear to have independently diverged in the ascidian lineage during evolution. Among them, Ci-C6ST-like1 and Ci-C6ST-like7 were predominantly expressed in the developing notochord. In addition, they were weakly expressed in the neural tube. The disruption of either one of them affected the convergent extension movement of notochordal cells. Presumptive notochord cells coming from both sides of the embryo did not intercalate. The results suggest that both of them are necessary. In some cases, the anterior neural tube failed to close. Forced expression of Ci-C6ST-like1 or Ci-C6ST-like7 in the notochord restored the normal intercalation of notochordal cells, indicating that the effects of morpholino oligos are specific. Conclusions: Ci-C6ST-like1 and Ci-C6ST-like7 are required for the morphogenesis of the notochord in the ascidian embryo. Developmental Dynamics, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here we investigate variation in genome-wide gene expression among Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba and four strains of Drosophila melanogaster during a major developmental transition—the start of metamorphosis. Differences in gene activity between these lineages follow a phylogenetic pattern, and 27\% of all of the genes in these genomes differ in their developmental gene expression between at least two strains or species. We identify, on a gene-by-gene basis, the evolutionary forces that shape this variation and show that, both within the transcriptional network that controls metamorphosis and across the whole genome, the expression changes of transcription factor genes are relatively stable, whereas those of their downstream targets are more likely to have evolved. Our results demonstrate extensive evolution of developmental gene expression among closely related species.},

	abstract = {The large volumes of sequencing data required to sample deeply the microbial communities of complex environments pose new challenges to sequence analysis. De novo metagenomic assembly effectively reduces the total amount of data to be analyzed but requires substantial computational resources. We combine two preassembly filtering approaches—digital normalization and partitioning—to generate previously intractable large metagenome assemblies. Using a human-gut mock community dataset, we demonstrate that these methods result in assemblies nearly identical to assemblies from unprocessed data. We then assemble two large soil metagenomes totaling 398 billion bp (equivalent to 88,000 Escherichia coli genomes) from matched Iowa corn and native prairie soils. The resulting assembled contigs could be used to identify molecular interactions and reaction networks of known metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology database. Nonetheless, more than 60\% of predicted proteins in assemblies could not be annotated against known databases. Many of these unknown proteins were abundant in both corn and prairie soils, highlighting the benefits of assembly for the discovery and characterization of novelty in soil biodiversity. Moreover, 80\% of the sequencing data could not be assembled because of low coverage, suggesting that considerably more sequencing data are needed to characterize the functional content of soil.},
