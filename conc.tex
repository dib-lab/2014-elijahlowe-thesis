\chapter{Conclusions}
Next generation sequencing is a great way to study non-model species. A broad swath of information can be gained from both RNA and DNA sequencing. This technology has allowed us to analyzed two closely related invertebrate chordates that also hybridize. This study has given us insight into the mechanisms behind tail-loss and development. Gene loss has occurred but other factors appear to be involved in tail-loss because expression from the tailed species appears to recover the loss features.
