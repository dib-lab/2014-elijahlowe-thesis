\section{Ascidian tail development}

The notochord is one of the distinguishing characteristics of chordates. In their adult form ascidians and their vertebrate cousins have little resemblance, however during development they have similar body plans that include the notochord \cite{jeffery_minireview_2002}. Ascidians are known for the bilateral and invariant cell cleavage, and their development is well described up to the gastrulation stage \cite{nishida_cell_1983,nishida_cell_1985,nishida_cell_1987}. Like vertebrates such as Xenopus, ascidians depend on maternally localized determinants to regulate cell moments and division, but while the development of the early body plans are similar the location and identity of these determinants are different \cite{lemaire_ascidians_2008}. Solitary ascidian notochords typically originate from two cell lineages, with the primary notochord deriving from the ``A'' blastomere and the secondary notochord deriving from the ``B'' blastomere \cite{nishida_cell_1983}.  Both ``A'' and ``B'' blastomeres can be identified at the 4-cell embryonic stage. At this stage the blastomeres are labeled according to the Conklin convention: ``a'' and ``A'' label the anterior animal and vegetal blastomeres, while ``b'' and ``B'' label the posterior animal and vegetal blastomeres \cite{conklin_organization_1905} . Although the notochords cells have been traced back to the 4-cell stage, notochord induction does not occur until the 32-cell stage. By the 64-cell stage there are 10 notochord cell precursors, the 8 primary precursor notochord cells\textemdash A lineage\textemdash which are no longer multipotent, and the 2 secondary notochord cells which are not restricted until the 110-cell stage \cite{nishida_cell_1985,yasuo_ascidian_1994,yasuo_conservation_1998,lemaire_unfolding_2009}. Two additional stages of cell division occur, one at gastrulation and one at neurulation, ending with the 40 notochord cells that are typical of most solitary ascidian tadpole larvae \cite{conklin_organization_1905}. At the onset of neurulation the notochord begins to form, a process that includes the closing of the neural tube and posterior movement of the notochord and muscle cells, followed by the mediolateral convergence of the notochord cells to the midline and then the polarization and intercalate of the cells through a process known as convergence and extension\cite{swalla_mechanisms_1993}. At this point the larval tail is constructed of a notochord flanked by 3 rows of muscles on each side, and both notochord and muscle cell derive from the same blastomeres \cite{nishida_cell_1985}. While the arrangement of the notochord cells is a stochastic process, the anterior 32-cells\textemdash primary notochord cells\textemdash are always formed by the A7.3 and A7.7 blastomere and the posterior most 8\textemdash secondary\textemdash notochord cells are always formed by the B8.6 blastomere; however, the ordering of the 32 most anterior is not determinate, in that cells from both the A7.3 and A7.7 intercalate in a random order (Figure~\ref{fig:noto_cells})\cite{nishida_cell_1983,nishida_cell_1985,miyamoto_formation_1985, swalla_mechanisms_1993,kourakis_one-dimensional_2014}. This process, along with muscle cell development, drives the formation of the larval tail \cite{miyamoto_formation_1985, jeffery_factors_1992,swalla_mechanisms_1993}.

Although a tailed larvae is typical of most ascidians, several species within the Stolidobranchia order have individually undergone tail-loss, many of which fall in the Molgulidae \cite{berrill_studies_1931, jeffery_evolution_1999, huber_evolution_2000, maliska_molgula_2010}. The tail-less\textemdash anural\textemdash species develop in a similar manner and are indistinguishable from their tailed\textemdash urodele\textemdash counterparts up to late gastrulation \cite{berrill_studies_1931, swalla_interspecific_1990, jeffery_factors_1992}. Anural ascidians lack several urodele features including an intercalated and extended notochord, differentiated muscle cells and the otolith sensory organ. The absence of differentiated muscles cells and intercalated notochord are the cause for the lack of tail in these species \cite{miyamoto_formation_1985, swalla_interspecific_1990}. The development of several tail-less species have been studied. \textit{M. tectiformis} notochord cells do not divide again after the 10 precursor cells are formed and \textit{M. occulta} stops dividing after 20 cells \cite{jeffery_evolution_1999}. The same occurs in \textit{M. bleizi}, however after the 20 notochord cells are formed, the embryo attempts to make a tail but never completes the process \cite{swalla_novel_1993}. It has also been shown that chordate embryos without fully developed notochord and/or muscle cells do not fully elongate or fail completely to develop a tail \cite{jeffery_evolution_1999,takada_brachyury_2002,stemple_structure_2005}. 
Seeing that most ascidians have tailed larvae and that the tail can be restored through the use of interspecies hybrids, the lack of tail has been shown to be a loss of function. \textit{M. oculata} and \textit{M. occulta} both of the Roscovita clade have been shown to produce hybrids in lab conditions. Of the known \textit{Molgula} species \textit{M. occulta} and \textit{M. oculata} are the only two that can hybridize. Although \textit{M. occulta} and \textit{M. oculata} have been found to dwell in the same habitat, hybrids have not been found in nature and have only been produced in lab conditions. Fertilizing \textit{M. oculata} eggs with \textit{M. occulta} sperm in most cases produce embryos with fully formed tails. The reciprocal hybrid produces an embryo with 20 notochord cells like \textit{M. occulta}, however the notochord cells converge and extent like \textit{M. oculata} \cite{swalla_interspecific_1990}. The ascidian tail has been shown to form in the presence of notochord and the absence of muscles cells \cite{miyamoto_formation_1985} and the hybrid tail is not flanked by muscle as in tailed species \cite{swalla_novel_1993}. However, also it has been shown that embryos that develop urodele features are batch specific, and only in embryos that express the p58 which is associated with cytoskeleton are urodele features restored \cite{swalla_identification_1991,jeffery_factors_1992}. It has also been shown that in hybrid embryos in which urodele features were restored, the number of cells that express acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in a vestigial muscle cell lineage increased in comparison to hybrids lacking urodele features and \textit{M. occulta} \cite{jeffery_evolutionary_1991}. This along with evidence that the ancestral notochord\textemdash the axochord\textemdash is muscle based \cite{lauri_development_2014}, suggests the need for both notochord and muscles cell lineages for the formation of the ascidian tail. 

\section{Brachyury has been shown to be the  }

\textit{Brachyury}, a T-box transcription factor, has been identified as essential for notochord development \cite{yasuo_conservation_1998}. Notochord induction is regulated by the \textit{FGF/MAPK/Ets} signaling cascade \cite{minokawa_binary_2001}. In particular, the A6.2 and A6.4 notochord/nerve cord precursors are induced by \textit{FGF9/16/20} at the 32-cell stage, just after the 7th cell cleavage \cite{satoh_ascidian_2001}. It was observed from isolation experiments that notochord/nerve cord precursors that lose \textit{FGF9/16/20} competence at the 32-cell stage assume the default nerve cord cell fate, but the converse is true for presumptive nerve cord blastomeres that are introduce to \textit{FGF}: they forgo their default nerve cord fate and become notochord \cite{yasuo_conservation_1998,minokawa_binary_2001}. If \textit{FGF9/16/20} is not present at the 32 cell stage competence is lost, \textit{bra} is not induced and the notochord no longer forms \cite{nakatani_basic_1996,nakatani_duration_1999}. This is because \textit{MAPK} is not activated and the induction of \textit{bra} and repression of \textit{FoxB} are not carried out \cite{hashimoto_transcription_2011}. Without the repression of \textit{FoxB TF} the notochord cell fate is repressed through the repression of \textit{bra}. It has been observed in \textit{H. roretzi} that \textit{FoxB} represses the activation of \textit{bra} predominately through the binding of Fox BS1 (GCACTGA\textit{ACAAACA}TACATAG). \textit{FoxB} is activated by \textit{ZicN} and is present in both nerve cord and notochords precursors, however is repressed by \textit{MAPK} in the notochord cell lineage at the 64-cell stage \cite{hashimoto_transcription_2011}. \textit{MAPK} is thought to be repressed by \textit{Ephin} which is one of the key differences between notochord and nerve cord determination. At this point \textit{bra} is expressed first weakly in the at the 64-cell stage in the notochord/nerve chord precursors \cite{yasuo_ascidian_1994} and unlike other chordates, in ascidians \textit{bra} is only expressed in the notochord cells \cite{yasuo_function_1993,corbo_characterization_1997,hotta_temporal_1999,takada_brachyury_2002}. Although \textit{bra} is necessary, its presence does not guarantee a tail. \textit{M. occulta} and \textit{M. tectiformis}, two tailless \textit{Molgula}, both express \textit{bra}. In both cases \textit{bra} expression stop earlier than that of \textit{M. oculata}, but produces different results. \textit{Bra} is expressed in the 10 precursor notochord cells in \textit{M. occulta}, and another round of cell division occurs which does not in \textit{M. tectiformis}.  In both of these species of \textit{Molgula} muscle actin genes have converted to pseudogenes, however because the mutation in the muscle actin genes are not the same they are likely independent \cite{swalla_novel_1993,jeffery_evolution_1999}. \textit{Manx} is another gene identified to be important for tell development in \textit{Molgula}, and while it is lowly expressed in \textit{M. occulta}, has been shown to restore the hybrid tail \cite{swalla_requirement_1996, swalla_multigene_1999}. 
  
After cell specification, the notochord cells must converge, intercalate and extend. The Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway is involved in cell movement during this process and mutations in \textit{prickle}\textemdash a known PCP gene\textemdash have been shown to cause a shortened ascidian tail by affecting both the mediolateral intercalation and the elongation of the ascidian tail \cite{jiang_ascidian_2005}. The \textit{pk} mutant \textit{aimless} produces a truncated tail, however the polarity of the nuclei are present, showing that prickle does not establish polarity within the cell but polarity between cells, acting in a local manner and perhaps their is a global organizer \cite{jiang_ascidian_2005,kourakis_one-dimensional_2014}. However, even in the absence of the PCP pathway considerable convergence and elongation of the notochord was observed in Ciona, driven by a presumed boundary effects \cite{veeman_chongmague_2008}.

Many of the upstream genes and transcription factors that interact with \textit{bra} have been studied in fair detail, through known-outs, and cell isolation experiments. Not as much detail is known about the downstream genes regulated by \textit{bra}. When a larger scale subtractive screening was done to identify genes downstream of \textit{bra}, 39 genes were initially found \cite{hotta_temporal_1999}. An attempt to characterize a number of these genes have been made, identifying functions such as extracellular matrix components (\textit{cadherin 8, entactin, fibronectin, laminin $alpha$1, $alpha$4, and $beta$1}, and {\em thrombospondin}), cell shape and polarity (\textit{pk, trop, ERM, ACL}), and axon guidance (\textit{netrin, semaphorin 3A}), amongst a host of other biological processes \cite{hotta_characterization_2000,hotta_brachyury-downstream_2007,kugler_evolutionary_2008}. 

\textit{Oikopleura}, a divergent (non-ascidian) urochordate species, also develops in a typical chordate manner with a notochord and also has a compact genome. However, in {\em Oikopleura} there are 20 notochord cells \cite{seo_miniature_2001,denoeud_plasticity_2010}. \textit{Oikopleura} retains its tail during its adult life stage and at this point \textit{bra} is not expressed in the adult notochord, however, \textit{bra} is expressed in the same manner in the developing larval notochord as ascidians \cite{bassham_brachyury_2000,nishida_development_2008}. When comparing gene networks, \textit{Oikopleura} did not exhibit the same mechanism for tail development as \textit{Ciona}: of the 50 bra target genes previously identified @cite, only 26 of them had homologs expressed in {\em Oikopleura}, so almost 50\% of the genes were not present \cite{kugler_evolutionary_2011}. Of the genes that did show homology, expression ranged from notochord-specific to tail including possible notochord to tissues that were clearly not the notochord.


\section{Assembling and analyzing data}

One of the major advances in biological sciences in the past 20 years has been the implementation of sequencing technologies. These technologies allow us to examine biological systems genomically, with increasing ease. The first widespread sequencing technology was Sanger sequencing in the 1986, but Sanger sequencing was not broadly used until 10 years later, when automated sequencers became available. Another technology, microarrays, which became popular starting in the mid '90s, allowed us to look at a wide spectrum of genes and understand relative expression within a sample. For example, Kobayashi et al. \cite{kobayashi_differential_2013} isolated and analyzed gene expression in notochord (A7.3+A7.7) and nerve cord (A7.4+A7.8) precursors using microarrays. This study was able to identify 106 genes expressed in the notochord precursor and 68 expressed in the nerve cord precursor at the 64-cell stage. Of these the genes, 36 notochord genes and 25 nerve chord genes were confirmed via Whole Mount In Situ Hybridization in the respective cells. This demonstrates the power of this technique, however, prior knowledge of the gene sequences involved were needed. \textit{C. intestinalis} was sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and is the best assembled and most well annotated ascidian genome \cite{dehal_draft_2002}. In addition to long reads (Sanger) scaffolding was done using experimental data\cite{satou_improved_2008}. Sanger sequencing able to sequence whole genomes without the need of prior knowledge to identify novel genes but was costly and time consuming\cite{metzker_emerging_2005,liu_comparison_2012}. 

Sanger was the $1$\textsuperscript{st} generation of sequencing technologies, and currently both $2$\textsuperscript{nd} and $3$\textsuperscript{rd} generation are in use, with Roche 454, Ion Torrent, Illumina and PacBio being the most wide spread. These technologies produce data far more easily and at a much lwoer cost than Sanger sequencing \cite{metzker_emerging_2005}. There are many trade-offs for each of the technologies, including cost per MB, sequencing time, prep cost, error rate and sequencing bias; in particular, 454 and PacBio have longer reads than Illumina and Ion Torrent, 800 bp and 1+kbp, respectively. However, both Illumina and Ion Torrent's short reads are cheaper to generate, produce more reads and are better for digital counting; in addition, PacBio has a very high error rate \cite{glenn_field_2011}. Illumina and Ion Torrent have the lowest error rates and while Ion Torrent is more sensitive to Single nucleotide polymorphisms, it also calls many more false positives.  For this reason, amongst other Illumina is the most used because it is the most versatile and performs the best in general \cite{quail_tale_2012}. The associated drop in sequencing price has yielded many of the assembled genomes within the Tunicata phyla. Outside of this project there are eight tunicate genomes assembled; \textit{C. intestinalis}, \textit{C. savignyi}, \textit{Oikopleura dioica}, \textit{Botryllus schlosseri}, \textit{Halocynthia uranium}, \textit{H. foretzi}, \textit{Phallusia fumigata}, and \textit{P. mammilata}, but no \textit{Molgula} genomes.
